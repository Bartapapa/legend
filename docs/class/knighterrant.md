## Challenge
As a Knight, the challenges you offer don't only carry social weight, but magical weight as well. When you <i>demand</i> that someone oppose you in a challenge of wits, strength or violence, they must accept, or suffer consequences.

For ordinary humans, the consequences of refusing a challenge are social embarrassment proportional to their standing among their peers. But for magical creatures, they can lose power and privileges, be sent into agonizing spasms or even die.

You can challenge any creature capable of understanding you and capable of being offended, but only once. If the circumstances or context changes dramatically between you both, you may challenge them again. In combat, you can challenge any creature you can see and who can hear you by yelling at them. Generally, creatures who accept will attack you.

Challenging someone or something that is obviously weaker, or of a lower standing than you generally means that you suffer the negative consequences of refusal, <i>especially</i> if you are subsequently defeated.

Take note of the highest HD of any creatures you've defeated by challenging them. This is known as your <b>Triumph</b>.

## Rise/Fall

## Bodyguard
When an adjacent ally is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to take the damage yourself. The damage is reduced by half.

## Additional attack
When the character attacks, they can roll an additional time to attack the same or another target.

## Courage
When you or your allies must roll to resist the effects of fear, you can roll with a bonus equal to your Triumph's HD if it is higher than the bonus you'd normally roll. You cannot use this effect if the Knight errant is already afraid.

## Foeslayer
When you challenge someone in physical combat, you deal an additional amount of damage equal to the highest HD of any creature you've defeated in challenge.

This effect takes place unless the last challenge you've had was a defeat. Once you defeat something via a challenge again, this effect is reinstated.
