## Challenge
As a Knight, the challenges you offer don't only carry social weight, but magical weight as well. When you <i>demand</i> that someone oppose you in a challenge of wits, strength or violence, they must accept, or suffer consequences.

For ordinary humans, the consequences of refusing a challenge are social embarrassment proportional to their standing among their peers. But for magical creatures, they can lose power and privileges, be sent into agonizing spasms or even die.

You can challenge any creature capable of understanding you and capable of being offended, but only once. If the circumstances or context changes dramatically between you both, you may challenge them again. In combat, you can challenge any creature you can see and who can hear you by yelling at them. Generally, creatures who accept will attack you.

Challenging someone or something that is obviously weaker, or of a lower standing than you generally means that you suffer the negative consequences of refusal, <i>especially</i> if you are subsequently defeated.

Take note of the highest HD of any creatures you've defeated by challenging them. This is known as your <b>Triumph</b>.

## Rise/Fall
This is a <b>flip ability</b>.

It starts as <b>Rise</b>. If ever you suffer a great defeat, such as letting a town be destroyed, it becomes <b>Fall</b>. If you succeed at a great victory, such as defeating a great evil, it becomes <b>Rise</b>.

Certain knight errant abilities change whether you're in Rise or Fall.

Any creature with noble blood or an understanding of knighthood, as well as magical creatures, know whether you're in Rise or Fall. Their initial Reaction roll will probably have a boon or bane according to this, depending on how they view knighthood in general.

## Bodyguard/Sacrifice
When an adjacent ally is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to take the damage yourself. Roll Grace. If successful, your ally takes no damage, and you take half damage.

If you're in <b>Fall</b>, you don't need to roll. You however take all damage.

## Additional attack
When the character attacks, they can roll an additional time to attack the same or another target.

## Courage/Stand tall
When you or your allies must roll to resist the effects of fear, you can roll with a bonus equal to your Triumph's HD if it is higher than the bonus you'd normally roll. You cannot use this ability if the Knight errant is already afraid.

If you're in <b>Fall</b>, you can suffer an additional amount of Wounds equal to your Triumph's HD before dying.

## Foeslayer/Unbreakable
When you challenge someone in physical combat, you deal an additional amount of damage equal to your Triumph's HD.

If you're in <b>Fall</b>, you have additional Armor against all damage caused to you by the target of your challenge equal to your Triumph's HD.
