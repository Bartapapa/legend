## Weathered
You start with a [Scar](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules/). Who, or what, gave it to you?

This Scar, and any other that you gain over the course of your career, are special. A bond exists between you and the object, creature, or situation that caused the Scar. If it's a creature, you can sense when they're close. If it's an object, you know who made it. If it's a situation, you have a boon to act against such situations.

## Surly air

## Firm grunt
You've mastered the art of communicating all intention in one sound. You can grunt at something with a modicum of intelligence or sense of self-preservation (people, dogs, bees, trees) - explain to the GM what this grunt means in one sentence with a maximum number of nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives equal to the number of steps you have as a veteran. The thing will understand you perfectly, and act according to its personality (the GM can ask for a reaction roll).

Until you take a good rest, you won't be able to grunt at that same thing a second time.

## Drinking buddies
Whenever you enter a town or a larger residential area, you recall one person who lives there. Give their name, and what they did when you were in the Army.
<b>Roll</b>, and add the number of steps you have in veteran.
*  <b>Failure.</b> They hated you - but you saved their life, once. They'll grant you one favor - and if they see your mug again, this time they'll break it.
*  <b>Partial success.</b> You were on good terms. They'll show you around, give you and your party a place to sleep for the night.
*  <b>Success.</b> You were friends. They'll give you information, and get out of their way to help you.
*  <b>Great success.</b> You were kinsmen in war. Your arrival is the sign that they've been waiting for. If you so wish, you can acquire them as a Follower. They'll probably be a level 1 Fighter, but the GM can decide on another class.

## Scores
You've scores to settle, and your past is bubbling up to torment you.
