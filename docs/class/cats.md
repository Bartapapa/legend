## Core ability

### Kitty claws
You can use Grace instead of Might to attack in close-combat. Additionally, you always have your claws as a tool, with a quality of d6.

## Faction abilities

### Catnap
You can Nap as many times as you want per day. If you Nap on a friend, they also heal 1 Fatigue. 

### Fat cat
You have money for days. If you or your friends need any mundane item, you can buy it, no questions asked.

### Very fancy
If you have fancy clothes, it acts as armor as long as you don't have any other armor. You can use the quality of any particularly fancy or valuable tool you have instead of your Wit in Reaction rolls.

### Pillow paws
As long as you don't have any heavy tools on you, you can be perfectly silent when you move. Additionally, if you spend 10 minutes pawing the surface of any object, it becomes pretty comfortable.

### Golden glint
You can recognize treasures from far away, even in the dark. You can't tell what they are exactly, but you know it'll be valuable. When you enter a room, you can tell if there's treasure nearby.
