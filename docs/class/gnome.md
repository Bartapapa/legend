## Faerie prank
Gnomes have blood from another realm, and have been bestowed several latent abilities related to it. Every time you gain this ability, roll 1d6, and gain that ability. If you already had the ability, reroll.

<summary>List of faerie pranks</summary>
*  <b>1: Pixie pockets.</b> Your pockets can fit strange things. You can hold in your Inventory one thing that is as large as you, and can retrieve items from your Inventory from other people's pockets.
*  <b>2: Poof!</b> By squeezing your eyes shut and holding your breath, you become completely silent and invisible.
*  <b>3: Greasy gnome.</b> You can secrete an oily substance covering your skin and making you really slippery. You can do this again after you eat a sandwich or something similar.
*  <b>4: Green thumb.</b> Your <i>Tongue of little beasts</i> becomes <i>Tongue of little beasts and flowers</i>.
*  <b>5: Lighter.</b> By snapping, you can make your thumb catch fire. You don't suffer from this fire, although it can still burn. It sheds light like a candle.
*  <b>6: Open/Close.</b> By looking at an object that's your size or smaller, you can make it open or close if it's not locked.

## Keenfolk
You're about as small as a dog. You can't wield medium or heavy melee weapons, or mechanical ranged weapons. On any non-combat roll where your size would be advantageous, you can either roll normally or roll and add the number of steps you have in Gnome, whichever is higher.

## Tongue of little beasts
When you meet an animal, magical or otherwise, that is smaller than you, roll 2d6 plus the number of steps you have in Gnome. This also acts as a Reaction roll.
* <b>Failure</b>. Don't know what they're on about.
* <b>Partial success</b>. You can communicate simple concepts and ideas to them during a medium-length conversation.
* <b>Success</b>. You can easily communicate complex ideas in any length of conversation.
* <b>Great success</b>. You can get a special follower! These act as normal followers, but you can put them in your Mind or your Inventory as you wish. They have 1 HP, and can do what an animal of their kind would be able to do.

## Whispers
When you sleep, you can ask the GM, "If I do X, will Y happen?". The GM can truthfully answer by Yes, No or Maybe.

## Knacks
You add one [Knack](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules) to each of your known Savvies. Every time you get a new one, add a Knack.

## Speak of the Gnome
You can feel when someone says your name. Wherever they are. You can choose to appear in a hidden spot right next to them when this happens. They must not be expecting you.
