## Gifts (base off of HP)

### 1. Stargazer
Once per night, as long as you can see the sky, you can ask it one question like 'If I do X, will Y happen?'. The GM will answer you honestly.

### 2. Artist
Over a nap, you can take two treasures and merge them into one object. They total their price, but gain the fragile trait. You can't merge an already fragile treasure with another. 

### 3. Crow's cant
You can make simple sounds with your mouth, and they seem perfectly natural. You can talk in this way to other crows, who understand you as if you were speaking normally.

### 4. Well-versed
If you stay in an inhabited area for an hour, you find out one problem the people have. The first time you enter an area with a proper name, the GM tells you one tidbit of useful information you didn't already know.

### 5. Crow's pact
If you shake hands with someone willing, they can't tell lies to you, nor you to them.

### 6. Shade cloak
If you don't move and you don't breathe while you're in any shadow that completely covers you, you become invisible.
