For every step of Elf the character takes, they get +1 Magic dice. Elves are [spellcasters](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#spellcasting).

<b>A:</b> Immortal perfection, Elf magic (1d6).

<b>B:</b> True shot, Elf magic (1d6+2).

<b>C:</b> Elven stride, Elf magic (1d6+4).

<b>D:</b> Perfect shot, Elf magic (1d6+6).

## Elven magic
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>List of Elf spells</b></summary>
* <b>1: Clarity.</b>
  R: Nearby, T: [dice] creatures, D: Instantaneous.
  
  Target makes another Save against a emotion-affecting effect (fear, anger, sadness, pleasure, pain). This can affect yourself.

* <b>2: Speak with Birds.</b>
  R: Far, T: birds, D: 20 minutes.
  
  You can talk to a bird, and it can talk back. If there is a party of 3-6 adventurer's moving through the forest nearby, a random songbird has a [dice]-in-6 chance of knowing where they are and if they're doing anything extra weird. Birds of prey are rarer, but more observant.

* <b>3: Blossom.</b>
  R: Touch, T: plant, D: permanent.
  
  Touched plant flourishes. Seeds germinate, flowerbuds swell and bloom, and a sickly plant regains vigor. Heals [sum] HP to a plant creature. If cast on a fruit, the fruit will grow up to the maximum normal size or 2x as big (whichever is smaller). Yes, you can use this to double your rations, as long as your rations are fruit or vegetables. 

* <b>4: Illusion of youth.</b>
  R: Touch, T: creature, D: [dice] days, or if [sum] > 12, until death.
  
  This spell cloaks you or your companions. You'll probably want to cast if before meeting a High Elf. Remember, you can't "see through" illusions, but you can pop it with a good solid blow. 

* <b>5: Locate animal.</b>
  R: [dice] miles, T: creature, D: [dice] hours.
  
  Name a common animal. You now know where the nearest example of the animal is.

* <b>6: Unseen orchestra.</b>
  R: 0, T: self, D: [sum] minutes.
  
  You are surrounded by the harmonious sounds of a five-piece band for the duration of the spell. The exact instruments vary caster to caster, and the unseen band can play any song you've heard before. It cannot duplicate speech. You can also opt to center the effect on an adjacent location, rather than on yourself.

## Immortal perfection
You're perfect in every way. You're also immortal, and may never die - at least, never die as an elf.

You start with 2 in each of your attributes. Whenever you would gain a Scar, instead of having it mangle your body or mind, you reduce one of your attributes by 1.

Getting dirty, humiliated or otherwise suffering from anything that reminds people you aren't perfect makes you suffer 1 Wound.

If ever one of your attributes reaches 0, or you accumulate 10 Wounds, you become a human - banal, mortal, and imperfect; lose all your Elf levels.

## Elf magic
Elves acquire spells over their career. Each time they get this ability, roll the die and add the bonus noted with it. You acquire that spell, and keep it in your Mind.

## True shot
When you hit someone with an arrow, you can cast one of your elf spells on them, disregarding the maximum distance of the spell.

## Elven stride
Natural, non-magical terrain doesn't affect you negatively in any way. You can walk on calm water. Your hair remains splendid after swimming in saltwater. Mud doesn't stain your boots. You don't cave into snow when you tread on it. Thorns part before you. Sand holds you just enough.

## Perfect shot
When you successfully hit someone with an arrow, you can do one second attack with your bow and arrow.
