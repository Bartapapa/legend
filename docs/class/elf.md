For every step of Elf the character takes, they get +1 Magic dice. Elves are [spellcasters](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#spellcasting).

<b>A:</b> Immortal perfection, Star-eyed

<b>B:</b> 

<b>C:</b> 

<b>D:</b> 

## Immortal perfection
You're perfect in every way. You're also immortal, and may never die - at least, never die as an elf.

You start with 2 in each of your attributes. Whenever you would gain a Scar, instead of having it mangle your body or mind, you reduce one of your attributes by 1.

If ever one of your attributes reaches 0, or you accumulate 10 Wounds, you become a human - banal, mortal, and imperfect; lose all your Elf levels.

## Star-eyed
As long as you can see the light of stars, all darkness is as sunlight to you. Works outside, but not indoors.

## Parry

## Additional attack

## Eyes of a killer
