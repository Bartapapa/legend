<b><u>Starting equipment:</u></b> A bow, arrows, bottled starlight (acts as a permanent torch).

<b><u>Starting savvies:</u></b> <i>The Times Before Time</i>, and your choice between <i>Fine arts</i>, <i>Music & Poetry</i> and <i>Wild beasts</i>.

For every step of Elf the character takes, they get +1 Magic dice. Elves are [spellcasters](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#spellcasting).

<b>A:</b> Immortal perfection, Elf magic (1d6).

<b>B:</b> True shot, Elf magic (1d6+2).

<b>C:</b> Elven stride, Elf magic (1d6+4).

<b>D:</b> Noblesse oblig√©, Elf magic (1d6+6).

## Immortal perfection
You're perfect in every way. You're also immortal, and may never die - at least, never die as an elf.

You start with 2 in each of your attributes. Whenever you would gain a Scar, instead of having it mangle your body or mind, you reduce one of your attributes by 1.

Getting dirty, humiliated or otherwise suffering from anything that reminds people you aren't perfect makes you suffer 1 Wound.

If ever one of your attributes reaches 0, or you accumulate 10 Wounds, you become a human - banal, mortal, and imperfect; lose all your Elf levels.

## Elf magic
Elves acquire spells over their career. Each time they get this ability, roll the die and add the bonus noted with it. You acquire that spell, and keep it in your Mind.

## True shot
When you hit someone with an arrow, you can cast one of your elf spells on them, disregarding the maximum distance of the spell.

## Elven stride
Natural, non-magical terrain doesn't affect you negatively in any way. You can walk on calm water. Your hair remains splendid after swimming in saltwater. Mud doesn't stain your boots. You don't cave into snow when you tread on it. Thorns part before you. Sand holds you just enough.

## Elven greatness
When a party member succeeds at a non-combat roll, or automatically succeeds at an action because of a Savvy, you can do the same. You just do it <i>better</i>.
