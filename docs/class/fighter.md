For every step of Fighter the character takes, they get +1 to attack rolls and maneuver rolls.

<b>A:</b> 2 Strikes, Notches
<b>B:</b> Parry
<b>C:</b> Additional attack
<b>D:</b> Eyes of a killer

## Strikes
Fighters perfect special attacks called Strikes. Whenever they attack, instead of doing a normal attack, they can choose to do one of the Strikes that they know. Fighters start with 2 known Strikes, and get an additional strike for every additional Fighter step they take. When doing so, they can replace one they already know with another one they have access to.

Here's a list of all common Strikes. More exotic ones exist, but they need to be taught by a master.

<summary>List of strikes</summary>
*  <b>Charging strike:</b> If you moved at least a few steps during your turn, make an attack against 1 target with a melee weapon. On a hit, the target is also shoved back.
*  <b>Cleaving strike:</b> Make an attack with a melee weapon with 1 bane. On a successful hit, you automatically deal your damage to up to two other targets in range.
*  <b>Defensive strike:</b> Make an attack with 1 bane. Whether you hit or not, the target has 1 bane against all attacks aimed at you for the following round.
*  <b>Disarming strike:</b> Make an attack with 1 bane. On a successful hit, you deal half damage to your target, and they drop their currently wielded weapon (or one of them, if they have two).
*  <b>Lunging strike:</b> Make an attack with a melee weapon with 1 bane. You can reach farther than usual with this attack.
*  <b>Piercing strike:</b> Make an attack with 1 bane. On a successful hit, ignore the target’s armor score.
*  <b>Pinning strike:</b> Make an attack with 1 bane with a weapon capable of piercing. On a successful hit, deal half damage. The target can’t move until it takes an action to remove the weapon. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you can’t attack with it either until it’s pulled out.
*  <b>Powerful strike:</b> Make an attack with 1 bane with a melee weapon. On a successful hit, roll twice the damage dice.
*  <b>Precise strike:</b> Forego your movement. Doing so, roll damage automatically – no need for an attack roll.
*  <b>Shield strike:</b> Make an attack with 1 bane with a shield. On a successful hit, deal 1d6 damage, and all attacks against that target have a boon, until at least one attack hits.
*  <b>Sundering strike:</b> Make an attack with 1 bane. On a successful hit, you deal no damage to the target, but you either reduce the armor score of your target by the number of damage dice your weapon has, or you impose a bane on the target’s attack rolls using this weapon. If another object is targeted, the GM determines the effects accordingly. This can stack, and lasts until the next time they tend to their equipment (generally after a short rest).
*  <b>Switch-up strike:</b> Switch places with a nearby ally, then attack.

## Notches
When you reach 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 kills in combat with a weapon type (like daggers, or longswords), you gain an ability that only you can use when you use this weapon type.
You can gain the same ability twice. Gain an ability from the following list:
*  +1 damage.
*  Special weapon trait (negotiated with the GM) – for example, instantly draw the weapon, wield 2-handed weapon in 1 hand, be able to use the weapon as a specific tool, etc…
*  Be able to tell at a glance whether the user of the same type of weapon would have more or less notches than you (generally, 10*HD notches is a good guess).

## Parry
When you, or an ally within reach, are hit with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce damage dealt by 1d6. If you are using a shield, roll 2d6 and keep the best.

## Additional attack
When the character attacks, they can roll an additional time to attack the same or another target.

## Eyes of a killer
You project a menacing aura around you. At any moment during combat, you can choose how weak creatures react to you. They either avoid fighting you at all costs, or gang up on you while ignoring your allies. Weak creatures are any creature that has 2 HD or less. In non-combat situations, you can terrorize them, make them run or cower. Other Fighters, or other characters with steps in a fighter-like class, know that you're not be trifled with at just a glance.
