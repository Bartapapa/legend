## Core ability

### Nose for trouble
You've got a great sense of smell, and can use your sense of smell as a tool, with a quality of d6. If you smell at a crossroads, the GM will tell you in which direction people need help.

## Faction abilities
Choose 1.

### Diplomatic immunity
If you do something mildly against the law, people will tend to let it slide. If it's <i>really</i> against the law, they'll still let it slide, but you'll have to explain yourself to the Dog Barons before using this ability again.

### Unbreakable spirit
Once per day, for one scene, you can choose to ignore all Fatigue you would gain. Additionally, you're immune to being afraid.

### Awesome might
Once per day, you can automatically roll the maximum result for your Might die. Creatures who have less Might than you will often try to avoid getting into a conflict with you.

### Nosy hound
Your sense of smell now has a d8 quality. You always recognize smells that you've smelled before, and can track them down if they've been in the area up to a few days ago (give or take with weather conditions).

### Protector
If a friend would suffer Fatigue or damage when they're right next to you, you can choose to take it in their place.
