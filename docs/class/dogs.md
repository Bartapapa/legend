## Core ability

### Flight
As long as you aren't carrying a Heavy tool, you can fly.

## Faction abilities
Choose 1. If you've <i>done something great</i> by the end of the session, get one more.

### Crow's pact
If you shake hands with someone willing, they can't tell lies to you, nor you to them.

### Artist
If you merge two objects together, they lose all their traits and you create 1 <i>treasure</i> of the same quality as the lowest-quality item you just merged.

### Crow's cant
You can make simple sounds with your mouth, and they seem perfectly natural. You can talk in this way to other crows, who understand you as if you were speaking normally.

### Shadow veil
If you don't move while in a shadow, you're invisible to everyone else.

### Stargazer
Once per night, as long as you can see the sky, you can ask it one question like 'If I do X, will Y happen?'. The GM will answer you honestly.
