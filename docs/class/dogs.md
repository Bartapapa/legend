## Core ability

### Flight
As long as you aren't carrying a Heavy tool, you can fly.

## Faction abilities
Choose 1.

### Diplomatic immunity
If you do something mildly against the law, people will tend to let it slide.

### Unbreakable spirit
Once per day, for one scene, you can choose to ignore all Fatigue you would gain. Additionally, you're immune to being afraid.

### Crow's cant
You can make simple sounds with your mouth, and they seem perfectly natural. You can talk in this way to other crows, who understand you as if you were speaking normally.

### Shadow veil
If you don't move while in a shadow, you're invisible to everyone else.

### Stargazer
Once per night, as long as you can see the sky, you can ask it one question like 'If I do X, will Y happen?'. The GM will answer you honestly.
