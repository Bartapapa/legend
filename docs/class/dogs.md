## Ability

### Nose for trouble
You've got a great sense of smell, and can use your sense of smell as a tool, with a quality of d6. If you smell at a crossroads, the GM will tell you in which direction people need help.

## Backgrounds (base off of Coin)

### 1. Scrapper
<b>Items:</b> Chain (2m), Tasty junk (food, treasure(20p))
<b>Skill:</b> Scavenging

### 2. Ruffrider
<b>Items:</b> Spiky collar, Iron muzzle trap
<b>Skill:</b> Intimidation

### 3. Guide
<b>Items:</b> Blue vest (light armor), Lantern (bright)
<b>Skill:</b> Tunnels

### 4. Herder
<b>Items:</b> Cow bell, Big stick (light melee)
<b>Skill:</b> Cattle

### 5. Warden
<b>Items:</b> Scaled armor (heavy armor), Flag
<b>Skill:</b> Law

### 6. Knight errant
<b>Items:</b> Sword, Shield
<b>Skill:</b> Heraldry

## Gifts (base off of HP)

### 1. Puppy eyes
If you do something mildly against the law, people will tend to let it slide. If it's <i>really</i> against the law, they'll still let it slide, but you'll have to explain yourself to the Dog Barons before using this ability again.

### 2. Unbreakable spirit
Once per day, for one scene, you can choose to ignore all Fatigue you would gain. Additionally, you're immune to being afraid.

### 3. Awesome might
Once per day, you can automatically succeed on a supernatural feat of strength (ripping a tree out of the ground, blocking a rolling 2-ton boulder, etc). Creatures who have less Might than you will often try to avoid getting into a conflict with you.

### 4. Nosy hound
Your sense of smell now has a d8 quality. You always recognize smells that you've smelled before, and can track them down if they've been in the area up to a few days ago (give or take with weather conditions).

### 5. Protector
If a friend would suffer Fatigue or damage when they're right next to you, you can choose to take it in their place.

### 6. Golden heart
People want to follow you. When you enter a town and loudly proclaim your quest, roll your best attribute. On a success, you gain 1 Follower. If they die, word may come out and your reputation might be lost.
