## Core ability

### Flight
As long as you aren't carrying a Heavy tool, you can fly.

## Faction abilities
Choose 1.

### Diplomatic immunity
If you do something mildly against the law, people will tend to let it slide.

### Unbreakable spirit
Once per day, for one scene, you can choose to ignore all Fatigue you would gain. Additionally, you're immune to being afraid.

### Great might
Once per day, you can automatically roll the maximum result for your Might die. Creatures who have less Might than you will often try to avoid getting into a conflict with you.
