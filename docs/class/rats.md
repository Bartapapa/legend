## Core ability

### Dark underbelly
Whenever you stay in an inhabited area for an hour or more, you can contact another rat. The rat can accomplish one favor for you as long as it doesn't put it into too much danger. You can convince it to get into danger if you have sufficient treasure to give it.

## Faction abilities
Choose 1.

### Junkfood
Any tool that is even slightly edible counts as food for you. You don't need to ever worry about finding enough to eat, bcause you eat pretty much anything.

### Ingenious
With an hour of time, you can merge any two non-heavy tools together into one single tool with the same traits as both items and the lowest quality of both. It is useless to anyone but you.

### Ratways
If you stay in an inhabited area for a day or more, you can discover a ratway that stretches from it and an inhabited area you've discovered before and that is maximum 3 areas away. You and your friends can use this ratway to move from one place to another, unseen by the surface world.

### Firestarter
If you have 10 minutes and some flammable material, you can make it catch fire. If there is no flammable material, it'll take you an hour to gather some.

### Ear to the ground
You can't ever be surprised by things sneaking up on you, ever. You know the difference between a room that is silent because there's nothing there, and a room that is silent because the things in there aren't making a sound.
