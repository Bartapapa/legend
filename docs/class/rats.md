## Gifts (base off of HP)

### 1. Possum
You can very convincingly play dead. You will feel, smell, and taste <i>really</i> dead, for as long as you like. Wild animals will avoid you. You can slow your heartbeat to becoming <i>very slow</i>, but then you actually fall unconscious for a while.

### 2. Ingenious
With an hour of time, you can merge any two non-heavy items together into one single tool with the same traits as both items. It is useless to anyone but you.

### 3. Ratways
If you stay in an inhabited area for a day or more, you can discover a ratway that stretches from it and an inhabited area you've discovered before and that is maximum 3 areas away. You and your friends can use this ratway to move from one place to another, unseen by the surface world.

### 4. Firestarter
If you have 10 minutes and some flammable material, you can make it catch fire. If there is no flammable material, it'll take you an hour to gather some.

### 5. Ear to the ground
You can't ever be surprised by things sneaking up on you, ever. You know the difference between a room that is silent because there's nothing there, and a room that is silent because the things in there aren't making a sound.

### 6. Junkfood
Any item that is even slightly edible counts as food for you. You don't need to ever worry about finding enough to eat, bcause you eat pretty much anything.
