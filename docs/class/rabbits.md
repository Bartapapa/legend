## Ability

### Friends in all places
When you stay somewhere where there are other people for a while, you automatically make a friend. They'll help you with certain things if you ask them nicely.

## Gifts (base off of HP)

### 1. People-reading
When you meet someone, you know 1 thing they love, and 1 thing they hate. If using the Lock & Key system, you learn 1 of each. You have a hunch when people are trying to hide their true intentions.

### 2. Good at multiplying
You can immediately count how many things are in a group. You can very quickly do simple calculations (something that is esoteric to any other animal), and if you have 10 minutes, you can do complex calculations.

### 3. Merry way
As long as you have a roaring fire and can tell a story for your friends out loud, any place is a good place to rest. You can use your Lives for your friends' rolls.

### 4. Hopped up
Once per scene, you can succeed at a feat of jumping high or far. Doing so, you suffer 1 Fatigue.

### 5. Charming
As long as you do the talking, you roll a d8 on Reaction rolls. Once per day, you can cast Charm as if you had the spellbook.

### 6. Rumormonger
At the end of the first day when you enter a town, you know as many local rumors as names of new people you've met.
