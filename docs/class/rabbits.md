## Core ability

### Friends in all places
When you stay somewhere where there are other people for a while, you automatically make a friend. They'll help you with certain things if you ask them nicely.

## Faction abilities
Choose 1.

### People-reading
When you meet someone, you know 1 thing they love, and 1 thing they hate. If using the Lock & Key system, you learn 1 of each. You have a hunch when people are trying to hide their true intentions.

### Good at multiplying
You can immediately count how many things are in a group. You can very quickly do simple calculations (something that is esoteric to any other animal), and if you have 10 minutes, you can do complex calculations.

### Merry way
As long as you have a roaring fire and can tell a story for your friends out loud, any place is a good place to rest. You can use your Lives for your friends' rolls.

### Hopped up
You can use your legs as a tool with a quality of d8. Once per scene, you can state that you rolled the maximum of 8 on your die, although you suffer 1 Fatigue after doing so.

### Sprinter
You always run faster than things you see. Once per scene, you can run faster than something that's supposed to be much faster than you - but you take 1 Fatigue after doing so.
