For every step of Wandering sage the character takes, they get +1 Sage's Wisdom.

<b>A:</b> Mysteries, Well-met

<b>B:</b> Ancient tongues, Well-traveled

<b>C:</b> Well-known

<b>D:</b> 

## Sage's Wisdom
Whenever you gain this ability, you can acquire one of the following savvies: <i>Folklore</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, <i>Philology</i>, <i>Mysticism</i>, <i>Monstrumology</i>, <i>Mythology</i>, <i>Runes & Glyphs</i>, <i>Geopolitics</i>, or something else you can convince the GM that remains along those lines.

## Mysteries
You have an additional attribute, called <b>Mysteries</b>. This starts at 0. Every time you encounter something strange or mysterious, write down a question related to that and increase your Mysteries by 1. Big, bad questions with far-reaching answers, not trivial ones. Whenever you are in a place where you can spend some time to get precise information, such as a library, archive, or mausoleum belonging to a thousand-year lineage, roll Mysteries. On a 13+, ask one of your questions to the GM, who will give you an honest answer. Cross that question out and reduce your Mysteries by the highest result of the 2d6, minimum 0.

If you learn the answer to your question organically, this doesn't reduce your Mysteries stat. You only reduce this stat when you use this ability.

## Well-met
You find that people are keen to aid you on the road, if you find the right words. When entering a town, if you, as a player, can speak aloud a small proverb or ideom, or a line or two of a poem you recently read or wrote, some inhabitants will always lend you a hand and give you and your party a place to stay for the night, as well as a warm meal. 

## Ancient tongues
Once per day, if you stumble upon a bit of language you don't understand, such as old runes, or some scripture in a book, you can say that you understand it. You don't necessarily understand the rest of the language - just that this particular part right here, you know what it means.

## Well-traveled
Whenever you enter a town, roll 2d6 and add the number of steps you have in Wandering sage. On a success, you've already been here before. You know two things about the town - one thing about its people, and another about one of its locations. Declare these aloud. The GM adds one bit of information to each declaration - perhaps something changed since the last time you were here, or your information was erroneous in some small but consequential way.
