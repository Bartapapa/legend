<b>A:</b> Mysteries, Well-met

<b>B:</b> Ancient tongues, Well-traveled

<b>C:</b> Well-known

<b>D:</b> Hidden speech

## Sage's trick
Whenever you gain this ability, you can acquire one of the following savvies: <i>Folklore</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, <i>Philology</i>, <i>Mysticism</i>, <i>Monstrumology</i>, <i>Mythology</i>, <i>Runes & Glyphs</i>, <i>Geopolitics</i>, or something else you can convince the GM that remains along those lines.

Additionally, you get one of the following tricks. Roll 1d6 to know which. If you already have it, reroll.

<summary>List of tricks</summary>
*  <b>1. Flask.</b> You always have a flask of alcohol on you. When you or a party member need a good slug, it's always just enough.
*  <b>2. Animal.</b> You have a small pet animal, such as a rat, a cat or a crow. It's smarter than the rest, can read things and generally does what you ask it to.
*  <b>3. Cowl.</b> When you wear practical headgear, you can choose to have it hide your face. People will think you're elderly, and generally write you off.
*  <b>4. Staff.</b> You have a knack for finding a staff. If your staff breaks or is lost, you find a new one in the next hour. Nobody can take your staff from you if you don't wish so.
*  <b>5. Smile.</b> People seem to take a shine when they first meet you, especially animals, children and elders.
*  <b>6. Mouth.</b> You can whistle clearly and loudly, blow smoke rings and tie knots with your tongue.

## Mysteries
You have an additional attribute, called <b>Mysteries</b>. This starts at 0. Every time you encounter something strange or mysterious, write down a question related to that and increase your Mysteries by 1. Big, bad questions with far-reaching answers, not trivial ones. Whenever you are in a place where you can spend some time to get precise information, such as a library, archive, or mausoleum belonging to a thousand-year lineage, roll Mysteries. On a 13+, ask one of your questions to the GM, who will give you an honest answer. Cross that question out and reduce your Mysteries by the highest result of the 2d6, minimum 0.

If you learn the answer to your question organically, this doesn't reduce your Mysteries stat. You only reduce this stat when you use this ability.

## Well-met
You find that people are keen to aid you on the road, if you find the right words. When entering a town, if you, as a player, can speak aloud a small proverb or ideom, or a line or two of a poem you recently read or wrote, some inhabitants will always lend you a hand and give you and your party a place to stay for the night, as well as a warm meal. 

You can't use the same proverb, ideom or poem twice.

## Ancient tongues
Once a day, you stumble upon a bit of language you don't understand, such as old runes, or some scripture in a book, you can say that you understand it. You don't necessarily understand the rest of the language - just that this particular part right here, you know what it means.

## Well-traveled
Whenever you enter a town, roll 2d6 and add the number of steps you have in Wandering sage. On a success, you've already been here before. You know two things about the town - one thing about its people, and another about one of its locations. Declare these aloud. The GM adds one bit of information to each declaration - perhaps something changed since the last time you were here, or your information was erroneous in some small but consequential way.

## Well-known
Whenever you meet a named NPC for the first time, you can declare you've met them. You know their name (or the one they're generally known as), and one thing they're known for. Roll 2d6 and add the number of steps you have in Wandering sage.
*  <b>Failure.</b> They remember you, all right. How could they not, after what you've done.
*  <b>Partial success.</b> They remember you. A face that piqued their interest.
*  <b>Success.</b> They remember you well, and you've helped them before.
*  <b>Great success.</b> At long last, you've returned.

## Hidden speech
When you use your Ancient Tongues ability, you are fluent enough in that language or dialect to be able to carry a medium-length conversation in it. You can also use your Ancient Tongues ability in regards to things that wouldn't normally be considered languages, such as the cries of songbirds, the red sun of the morn, the rumbling of thunder, the clinking of gold coins, the squeal of machinery or the silence of the wind.

his means you can talk to birds, briefly. Or the sun. Or bees. Or rainbows.
