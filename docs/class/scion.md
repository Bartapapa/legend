<b><u>Starting equipment:</u></b> Robes befitting the traditions of your religion, a wooden holy symbol, a staff (light melee) and a dagger.

For every step of Scion the character takes, they get +1 Omen. Scions are [spellcasters](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules).

<b>A:</b> Omens, Faith

<b>B:</b> 

<b>C:</b> 

<b>D:</b> 

## Omens
Scions do not choose their spells. Their god does. Every day.

When you wake up, you lose all previous spells you've had granted by this class, and acquire a number of spells according to the number of steps you have in Scion. The GM chooses these spells according to things that might happen in the day - it is up to the player to interpret what the spells mean. Getting a spell that grants resistance to fire can mean seeing a dragon in the near future. Or perhaps having to walk on lava.

Your god can give you any spell it wishes. It doesn't care about spell lists or classes. It generally remains within the purview of its domains of influence, however nothing is forcing it to do so.

## Faith
Scions have <b>Faith dice</b> (or FD), which act like magic dice in every way except that when they're lost, they cannot be regained. Scions are granted FD when they act according to the wishes of their god. Make up 4 different tenets that your god wants you to follow. You can check out the [Tenets](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/classes/scion#tenets) if you're in a hurry.

## Parry

## Additional attack

## Tenets
Gods want you o do things in their name. A lot of gods want similar things - you can mix-and-match these according to their general domain of influence.
