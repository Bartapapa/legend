For every step of Ranger the character takes, they get +1 Favored Land.

<b>A:</b> 2 Favored Land, Hunter from far lands

<b>B:</b> Trail

<b>C:</b> Bestial takedown

<b>D:</b> ???

## Favored land
Choose two of the following adjectives: <b>barren, populated, abandoned, forested, frigid, windswept, arid, damp, craggy, dark, coastal, spooky</b>. While in an area described by that adjective, you can light a fire (given tools, fuel, an hour and cooperative weather), find enough food for one person, follow tracks a local day old, and may protect one person from poor conditions.

Every time you level up, select another adjective. Effects stack. Adjectives may be selected multiple times.

## Hunter from far lands
You have +1 on attack rolls against unintelligent beasts for each of the following things you know about it: its age, sex, proper scientific name, and where it slept last night.

People tend to believe what you say in regards to the wilderness if you show that you have a bigger knife than them.

## Trail
You can follow a trail of up to [number of ranger steps] days old, so long as you know who, or what, created it.

## Bestial takedown
When the ranger attacks, they can roll an additional time to attack the same or another target, as long as it's an unintelligent beast.

As an action, you can attempt a bestial takedown on an unintelligent beast with less HD than you have steps in Ranger. You jump on the creature. Describe what strange, esoteric method you're using (sticking your thumbs in its earholes, stroking it under the neck, giving it a noogie will yelling YEE-HAW, etc) and roll 2d6 and add your steps as Ranger.
* <b>Failure.</b> It pissed it off even more. Now it's out for blood, and it won't run away.
* <b>Partial success.</b> The creature is stunned for 1 round.
* <b>Success.</b> It immediately pacifies the creature. If you don't threaten it further, it won't follow.
* <b>Great success.</b> It immediately pacifies the creature, and changes its Reaction to friendly.
