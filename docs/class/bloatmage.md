<small>Inspired by Pathfinder's [Bloatmage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/a-b/bloatmage/), and adapted with Hilander's [Ogre](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/ogre).</small>

<b><u>Starting equipment:</u></b>

For every step of Bloatmage the character takes, they get +1 Bloat. Bloatmages are [spellcasters](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules).

<b>A:</b> Bloat, Devour

<b>B:</b> 

<b>C:</b> Enhanced devour

<b>D:</b> 

## Bloat
You have as many <b>Bloat</b> as you have steps in this class. Each Bloat fills one slot in your inventory, and can't be lost normally. If you don't eat 2 rations per day, you lose 1 Bloat. If you spend the equivalent of a Treasure while [celebrating](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules), you regain 1 Bloat, up to your maximum Bloat as determined by the number of steps you have in this class.

For every Bloat you have in your inventory, you gain +2 maximum HP, and +1 <b>Magic dice</b>, that you can use to cast spells.

You are particularly weak to any effect that causes <b>bleeding</b>, and have a bane to resist such effects. Particularly strong bleeds, or getting your entrails sucked out, can make you lose 1 Bloat.

## Devour
Your teeth are a weapon that deals 1d6 damage. You can eat anything as big as a chicken and softer than stone as a ration. You have a boon on resisting the effects of rot and poison you ingest.

## Enhanced devour
Your teeth become a weapon that deals 1d6+2 damage. Anything that you chomp on becomes <b>grappled</b> by you, and can't move unless it takes an action to tear itself away from you.

## Parry

## Additional attack

## Eyes of a killer
