<b><u>Starting equipment:</u></b> Depends on wizard school.

<b><u>Starting savvies:</u></b> <i>The Arcane</i>, and your choice between <i>History</i>, <i>Occult</i> and <i>Theology</i>. Your wizard school can grant a few more choices.

For every step of Magic user the character takes, they get +1 <b>Magic dice</b>.

<b>A:</b> Wizard school, Magic sense, 2 spells (1d6)

<b>B:</b> Spell breeding, 1 spell (1d6+2)

<b>C:</b> Familiar spell, 1 spell (1d6+4)

<b>D:</b> Spell mastery, 1 spell (1d6+6)

## Wizard school
Magic users belong to a school, and acquire <b>Cantrips</b> and spells from the school's <b>Spell list</b>. A school isn't necessarily an institution, rather a mode of thought.

Choose one when getting your first Magic user level.

Here's a list of all common Wizard schools. More exist in the outside world.

## Magic sense
You can taste and smell magic around you. You know when an object is magical by touching it. You have a general idea of what magic items do by spending an hour with them.

Additionally, you know the ritual to carve spells into the inside of your skull. Over the course of 8 hours, you can destroy an object which has a spell caught within. Doing so fuses the spell into you, taking up 1 Mind slot. This is why mage-hunters cut off their bounty's head. The Magic user can remove a spell from their Mind over the course of 10 minutes if they so wish, liberating the spot. Some spells like the cozy interior of the Magic user's cranium, so it might not be without effort to do so.

If the Magic user has a scroll or an empty spellbook prepared for the spell, it can cast the spell into that instead of letting it run away.

## Spells
Roll the dice that is marked, and add any modifiers. You get the corresponding spell from your school's spell list. If you already have it, you take the one above or below until you reach a new spell.

When you acquire a new spell, you can choose to either have it as a spellbook of your creation, or already have it carved inside your head.

## Spell breeding
You can attempt to merge and crossbreed two spells into a new spell. This takes a week of uninterrupted work. Both spells need to be stored on separate spellbooks or scrolls initially. These two spells are destroyed. You produce, as you choose, either:
*  A random spell from your spell list (1d10).
*  A random spell from a random spell list (1d12).
*  A [mutant](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/classes/magic-user#spell-mutations) version of one of the two spells.

## Familiar spell
Choose a spell you cast often. You ignore mishaps provoked by doubles when casting this spell.

Additionally, roll one [positive mutation](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/classes/magic-user#spell-mutations) for the spell.

## Spell mastery
Choose a spell you cast often. You can always cast this spell with 1 MD, even if you don't have any left.

## Spell mutations
<small>Stolen from Arnold K's [Spell mutations](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/mutant-spells.html).</small>

When you find a spell out in the wild, roll 1d6. On a 1, the spell is a <b>Mutant</b>. Roll 2d6 once on the positive mutations and 2d6 once on the drawbacks below.

<b>2: Improved stability.</b> When rolling MD to cast this spell, you can roll one of the used die to one of its sides.

<b>3: Improved subtlety.</b> Nobody can tell if you're casting this spell.

<b>4: Improved strength.</b> The spell has a boon on attack or power rolls.

<b>5: Improved effect.</b> The spell does more of what it already does. 1d6 becomes 2d6 or 1d6+2, whatever.

<b>6: Improved range.</b> Range is increased by one step.

<b>7: Doubled.</b> Roll twice on this table. Reroll 7s.

<b>8: Improved duration.</b> Duration is doubled.

<b>9: Improved area of effect.</b> Area is increased by one step. Group now affects a Room, Room now affects a House, House now affects a Castle, etc.

<b>10: Improved applicability.</b> Spell can be more broadly applied. Charm beast becomes Charm creature, for example.

<b>11: Improved control.</b> Spell can now be more fine-tuned, such as leaving gaps in a fireball.

<b>12: Sentient.</b> The spell is much smarter than normal. It can act on its own and talk to you. If it is angry, it might not cast. If it is pleased, it might be enhanced in some way.
