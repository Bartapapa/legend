<b><u>Starting equipment:</u></b> Depends on wizard school.

<b><u>Starting savvies:</u></b> <i>The Arcane</i>, and your choice between <i>History</i>, <i>Occult</i> and <i>Theology</i>. Your wizard school can grant a few more choices.

For every step of Magic user the character takes, they get +1 <b>Magic dice</b>.

<b>A:</b> Wizard school, Magic sense, 2 spells (1d6)

<b>B:</b> Spell breeding, 1 spell (1d6+2)

<b>C:</b> Familiar spell, 1 spell (1d6+4)

<b>D:</b> Spell mastery, 1 spell (1d6+6)

## Wizard school
Magic users belong to a school, and acquire <b>Cantrips</b> and spells from the school's <b>Spell list</b>. A school isn't necessarily an institution, rather a mode of thought.

Choose one when getting your first Magic user level.

Here's a list of all common Wizard schools. More exist in the outside world.

## Magic sense
You can taste and smell magic around you. You know when an object is magical by touching it. You have a general idea of what magic items do by spending an hour with them.

Additionally, you know the ritual to carve spells into the inside of your skull. Over the course of 8 hours, you can destroy an object which has a spell caught within. Doing so fuses the spell into you, taking up 1 Mind slot. This is why mage-hunters cut off their bounty's head. The Magic user can remove a spell from their Mind over the course of 10 minutes if they so wish, liberating the spot. Some spells like the cozy interior of the Magic user's cranium, so it might not be without effort to do so.

## Spells
Roll the dice that is marked, and add any modifiers. You get the corresponding spell from your school's spell list. If you already have it, you take the one above or below until you reach a new spell.

When you acquire a new spell, you can choose to either have it as a spellbook of your creation, or already have it carved inside your head.

## Spell breeding


## Familiar spell
Choose a spell you cast often. You ignore mishaps provoked by doubles when casting this spell. Additionally

## Spell mastery

## Spell mutations

When you find a spell out in the wild, roll 1d6. On a 1, the spell is a <b>Mutant</b>. Roll 2d6 once on the positive mutations and 2d6 once on the drawbacks below.

<b>3: Improved subtlety.</b> Nobody can tell if you're casting this spell.

<b>4: Improved strength.</b> Targets have a bane to resist the spell.

<b>5: Improved effect.</b> The spell does more of what it already does. 1d6 becomes 2d6 or 1d6+2, whatever.

<b>11: Improved control.</b> Spell can now be more fine-tuned, such as leaving gaps in a fireball.
