<b>D:</b> True death

## Quick win
You have a boon on all attack and maneuver rolls during the first turn of combat.

## Assassinate
If the enemy doesn't suspect an attack, you can attempt to assassinate them. The attack is an automatic hit. They immediately die, no save, if their HD is less than the number of important facts you know about the person, to a maximum of the number of steps you have in assassin. Important facts are anything that is information that couldn't be gleaned from just looking at the person.

This also works in combat, but only during the first round, as long as you haven't attacked anyone else.

## Mr. So-and-so
When carousing, the assassin has another action available to them.

<summary><b>Forge identity</b></summary>

For each Valuable spent this way, spend a day creating a new identity of a common folk (peasant, merchant, etc,...), complete with papers and disguise. You acquire the disguise as an item in your Inventory. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, one of your identities is that of a person of interest belonging to an organization, group, or religion (state which one specifically), and well-regarded within it. You can take someone else's identity, although confidants will never be duped.

## Invisible stalker
In any non-combat scene, as long as your position hasn't been accurately defined yet, you can choose to just disappear. People who were keeping an eye out for you suspect something is up. You can reappear anytime by stating so - in the shadows, in a cupboard, masquerading as an unnamed NPC standing by, etc. Until you state that you are there, you don't actually hear or know anything that's going on in the current scene.

## True death
The assassin's technique becomes otherworldly, and their death-dealing affects even those who are supposed to be immune to it. Any creature killed by the assassin via their assassinate ability is impossible to resurrect, their soul destroyed by the attack. This affects creatures which do not normally die in the conventional sense.
