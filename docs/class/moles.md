## Core ability

### Mole claws
You can use your claws as a tool, with d6 quality. You dig through soft earth as if you were 5 animals with shovels.

## Faction abilities

### Blind faith
When you see an entrance to another tunnel or corridor, you instinctively know in which direction it goes and generally have an idea where it ends up geographically. You have no need for light.

### Greed
For every treasure you have in your Inventory, you can ignore 1 Fatigue (stick it on the same slot as the treasure to remember). 

### Deep-hearted
When you reach a new level of Depth, you can recover 1 Fatigue. You count any subterranean conditions as being comfortable to rest in. By staying in an area underground for an hour, you have a general sense of what is the most dangerous thing that lives there.

### Preach
When you speak aloud for an hour in an inhabited area, you attract an audience of 20 animals (50 if you're underground). They are captivated by you while you continue speaking. Once per day, as you're preaching, you can cast Suggestion as if you had the spellbook, but this targets all creatures listening to you.

### Commune with the Dirt Heart
When you're in a room with absolutely no light, and have 10 minutes to whisper quietly, choose 2 of the following things:
*  Find out the current Clock value.
*  Roll on the Omen table.
*  Find out if there are any unexplored rooms left.
*  Find out about who last set foot in the room you're in.
