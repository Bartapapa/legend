<summary>List of tricks</summary>
*  <b>11: Acquired Immunity.</b> You can smell poison. You have a boon to resist poisons.

*  <b>15: Cat's grace.</b> You have a boon on rolls to defend when not wearing armor.
*  <b>16: Con artist.</b> Once per session, exchange 1 Trash for 1 Valuable. The person you did this to will not appreciate it when they find out.
*  <b>21: Escape artist.</b> Once per session, get out of restraints (grapple, shackles, rope, etc) as long as you plausibly could.
*  <b>22: Fashion victim.</b> Fancy clothes count as 1 Armor, and don't take up an Inventory slot.
*  <b>23: Field medic.</b> You can stabilize dying characters with your bare hands. If you have tools, you have a boon.
*  <b>24: Forgery.</b> Once per session, during a short rest, you can make a near-exact copy of any item. It's unusable and worthless.
*  <b>25: Gossip.</b> Once per session, you can recall an embarrassing secret of another NPC you've already met. Describe it. You might be wrong, but it's still funny.
*  <b>26: Jester.</b> You can make yourself appear as the most or least important person in the group at any time.

*  <b>41: Saboteur.</b> You can take 10 minutes to break any nonmagical object.
*  <b>42: Cheat death.</b> Once in your life, cheat death. They won't like it at all. Lose this trick when you do so and get a new one.
*  <b>43: Hedge magician.</b> You know whether something is magical by tasting it. You have 1 Magic Dice that regenerates overnight if you lose it.
*  <b>44: Square meal.</b> You heal 1 Wound during lunch if you drink alcohol.
*  <b>45: Tinker.</b> You can spend 10 minutes to merge two nonmagical objects together in your inventory. They only take up one space, and is useless if not used by you. You cannot merge an item that's already been merged.

*  <b>52: Alert.</b> You're never surprised. In combat, you can take a full turn before anyone else.
*  <b>53: Silver tongue.</b> Once per session, you can lie and have someone believe it as long as it's plausible. They'll find out after 1d6 minutes.
*  <b>54: Coward.</b> You run faster when running away from something. Unless it's really fast, it won't catch you.
*  <b>55: Evaluate.</b> You instantly know the value of any Civilized object, as well as any object related to one of your savvies.

*  <b>61: Weasel.</b> If you don't attack during your turn, all attacks against you have a bane, unless you can't see the enemy.

*  <b>64: Actor.</b> You can copy the voice of anyone you've listened to over the past 10 minutes. You can even make some very specific sounds, but that's probably a roll.
*  <b>65: Possum.</b> You can very convincingly play dead after being hit. People will generally leave you alone to attack your allies. Unless it's a beast that eats dead things.
*  <b>66: Redirect.</b> When you roll a great success when defending, you can redirect the attack to someone else nearby.

## Unnamed bag
When you leave town, you can spend one of your objects, and acquire an unnamed bag. At any point during the adventure, you can open that bag, and reveal that it was an object (or bunch of objects) that could've plausibly been bought with your spent object. You can have up to 2 unnamed bags in your inventory.

## Specialist savvy
When you get this ability, you gain one of the following savvies: <i>Moving silently</i>, <i>Scrounging for trinkets</i>, <i>Reading moods like a book</i>, <i>Smooth-talking</i>, <i>Picking pockets</i>, <i>Picking locks</i>, <i>City underbelly</i>, <i>Speaking in code</i>, and <i>Finding your way out of a tight spot</i>.

## Opportunistic
Whenever you have a boon in combat, you can expend it to make one additional movement, or add 1d6 damage to your attack.

## Mastery
Choose one of your savvies, which becomes your Master savvy. You automatically succeed in doing anything related to that savvy - even if it's virtually impossible. As long as you can plausibly explain it.
