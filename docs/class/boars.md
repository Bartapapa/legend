## Core ability

### Vigorous
Increase the [size] of your Vigor by one step (from 6, become 8). Once per day, the first time you suffer from Fatigue, ignore it.

## Faction abilities

### Stubborn
Magical effects that have a maximum [size] less than the [size] of your Vigor don't affect you. 

### Strong hide
As long as you aren't wearing any armor, you're counted as having 1 armor. Once per day, you can ignore one instance of Vigor damage.
