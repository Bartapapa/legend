## Core ability

### Vigorous
Increase the [size] of your Vigor by one step (from 6, become 8), and gain 2 Inventory slots. Once per day, the first time you suffer from Fatigue, ignore it.

## Faction abilities

### Stubborn
Magical effects that have a maximum [size] less than the [size] of your Vigor don't affect you.

### Strong hide
As long as you aren't wearing any armor, you're counted as having 1 armor. Once per day, you can ignore one instance of Vigor damage.

### Spiritual commune
When you stay in a graveyard, or somewhere where multiple people are buried, for 10 minutes, you can do two of the following things:
*  Know what the weather will be like tomorrow.
*  Know the name of the strongest thing that controls the area.
*  Have the name of a place or character told to you to guide you on the right path.
*  Find out 3 elements of the safest place around these parts (based off of 3 different senses from taste, smell, sight, hearing and touch).

### Surface explorer
You know how to find food, find shelter, and protect your friends from any harmful conditions usually found in any area that the GM describes as damp, lush, wooded, grassy, or hilly. When you arrive in an area that could be defined by one of these adjectives, the GM will give you one bit of useful information about it.

### A taste of home
Over a nap when you eat food that you've prepared yourself, or that someone from your tribe prepared, you count as having taken a long rest. When you taste any food, you can know the food is edible or if it's been poisoned. When someone discovers a new piece of inedible flora, you can declare what special esoteric technique your tribe used to cook it to make it edible.
