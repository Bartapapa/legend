## Tiny luck
You're as small as a mouse, and benefit and suffer from all of the advantages and drawbacks that that entails.

You only have 1 HP, and can't gain more HP than that, ever, through any circumstance. Armor doesn't work on you. You can only deal 1 damage. You can only carry things that are smaller than you. Tall people will think less of you. You're considered to have -3 Might, although this can be changed with magic, for example.

However, you've got <b>Lucky dice</b> (or LD). These lucky dice are d6s. You can roll them whenever you take damage - if the [sum] is more than the damage you took, you actually avoided it entirely, luckily. You only lose LD when it comes up as '6'. You can even avoid attacks that you didn't see coming, because, let's face it - it's hard shooting a mouse with an arrow. Otherwise, you follow the same rules for Wounds as everyone else. You can recuperate 1 lost LD when you wake up, and when you show everyone that your size doesn't matter.

## Scurry
Enemies can't stop you by trying to block your path. With acrobatics and speed, you zip and dive past their feet or other appendages. You always find a way of moving at the same speed as your allies (so you can still move into a nearby spot by use of your movement). You can freely climb onto enemies you're in contact with, no check required (unless they're really slippery).

## Weak spot
Whenever you successfuly land an attack on a creature at least twice your size, you deal damage as usual, but you can also hit a weak spot (if it was a melee attack, this works on a partial success, otherwise a full success is needed). To do so, roll as many LD as you want - the effects of the attack depend on the [sum] of the dice and the number of [dice] used. By striking a weak spot, you always deal +[dice] damage. You can only use a weak spot if the target conceivably has those weak spots. Humans have eyes. Dragons have tongues. Oozes from another dimension don't.

<summary>List of weak spots</summary>
*  <b>Lookers.</b> Eyes and the like. Blind the target for 1 round. If [sum] > 12, you poke the eye out.
*  <b>Shouters.</b> Mouths and things to babble with. The target can't speak comprehensibly for 1 round. This interferes majorly with most spellcasting. If [sum] > 12, you shred the tongue to ribbons.
*  <b>Grabbers.</b> Hands, pincers and tentacles. The target drops whatever they're holding in that hand.
*  <b>Sitters.</b> Butts. The target immediately moves where you want nearby.
*  <b>Steppers.</b> Feet, legs and such. The target can't move for 1 round. If [sum] > 12, it falls over.
*  <b>Nethers.</b> Where the sun don't shine. Every action against the target has a boon for 1 round.
*  <b>Flappers.</b> Wings and such. The target can't fly for 1 round.

## Fancy hat
You acquire a fancy hat that takes one spot in your Inventory. It keeps you cool during warm days. As long as you have it on, you have a bonus equal to the number of steps you have in Mouser to reaction rolls with the secret baronnies of small beasts. If you lose it, you'll find another one next time you go into town.

Once per session, you can tip your hat. Doing so, you get a temporary +1 LD that lasts until the end of the encounter.

## Additional attack
When the character attacks, they can roll an additional time to attack the same or another target.

## Weaker spots
You increase your ability to cause carnage by striking weak spots. When you hit a weak spot, the penalty continues applying until the target uses its action (unless, of course, the weak spot was obliterated, such as gouging the eye out or shredding the tongue).

## Fancier hat
If you take damage, you can opt to lose your fancy hat. When you do so, gain a Scar. Time goes slow as you see your life flash past your eyes. In order to use this ability again, you're going to need to pick it up. Use this ability too many times, and <b>Death of Small Beasts</b> will come for you. They do not like to be cheated for so long.
