For every step of Dwarf the character takes, they get +1 Inventory slot.

<b>A:</b> Tiny, 

<b>B:</b> Greed, Additional attack

<b>C:</b> Delver's heart

<b>D:</b> Stubborn

## Tiny
You're as small as a mouse, and benefit and suffer from all of the advantages and drawbacks that that entails.

You only have 1 HP at any point in your career. Armor doesn't work on you. You can only deal 1 damage.

## Smell treasure
You can smell gold, jewels, gems, crystals, and precious metals. If you stand at a crossroads and sniff, the GM will tell you which direction has the most treasure. If you sniff an empty room, the GM will tell you if you smell the scent of hidden riches.

Strong smells can make it hard to smell treasure.

## Greed
For every inventory slot filled with Valuables or Treasures, you get +1 HP. Each Valuable braided into your beard grants +1 HP.

## Delver's heart
You instinctively know when all secret doors and passages have been discovered in a room. Whenever you encounter a new passage or door, you instinctively know the direction where it leads, as well as a basic description of the room it ends up to, if any.

## Stubborn
You become so stubborn magic cannot affect you. All magic, good or bad, doesn't affect you at all. Shaving your beard cancels this effect until it is fully grown again.
