For every step of Mouser the character takes, they get +1 Lucky dice.

<b>A:</b> Tiny luck, Scurry, Weak spot

<b>B:</b> Greed, Additional attack

<b>C:</b> Delver's heart

<b>D:</b> Stubborn

## Tiny luck
You're as small as a mouse, and benefit and suffer from all of the advantages and drawbacks that that entails.

You only have 1 HP, and can't gain more HP than that, ever, through any circumstance. Armor doesn't work on you. You can only deal 1 damage. You can only carry things that are smaller than you. You're considered to have -3 Might, although this can be changed with magic, for example.

However, you've got <b>Lucky dice</b>. These lucky dice are d6s. You can roll them just like magic dice - if the [sum] is more than the damage you took, you actually avoided it entirely. You only lose LD when it comes up as '6'. You can even avoid attacks that you didn't see coming, because, let's face it - it's hard shooting a mouse with an arrow. Otherwise, you follow the same rules for Wounds as everyone else.

## Scurry
Enemies can't stop you by trying to block your path. With acrobatics and speed, you zip and dive past their feet or other appendages. You always find a way of moving at the same speed as your allies (so you can still move into a nearby spot by use of your movement). You can freely climb onto enemies you're in contact with, no check required (unless they're really slippery).

## Weak spot
Whenever you successfuly land an attack, you deal damage as usual, but you also hit a weak spot. 

## Greed
For every inventory slot filled with Valuables or Treasures, you get +1 HP. Each Valuable braided into your beard grants +1 HP.

## Delver's heart
You instinctively know when all secret doors and passages have been discovered in a room. Whenever you encounter a new passage or door, you instinctively know the direction where it leads, as well as a basic description of the room it ends up to, if any.

## Stubborn
You become so stubborn magic cannot affect you. All magic, good or bad, doesn't affect you at all. Shaving your beard cancels this effect until it is fully grown again.
