<b>D:</b> 10 minutes (Varies) <b>T:</b> Self <b>R:</b> 5m-radius sphere

Choose up to [dice] abstractions or forces (time, death, sight, taxes) when casting this spell. A 5m-radius sphere expands from you when cast - the affected area is completely exempt from these things (the GM adjucates how the universe interprets this). No such manifestation of an abjured thing can cross into, or be present in, the area. If 4 MD are used to cast this spell, the spell lasts until the caster leaves the area.
