You smite a target you can see with divine power. Speak a phrase condemning the target. You deal [sum]+[dice] damage as a beam of fire descends from the skies - if the damage isn't enough to reduce its HP to 0, it is unscathed and immune to any further Smites from you, forever. If the damage is enough, their body is destroyed, as is their soul.

On a Mishap, if you destroy the target, you add a Dark Passenger to your Mind, taking up a slot. They'll speak to you, eventually.
