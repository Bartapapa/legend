Draw a line in material. A line needs to be drawn - you can pour sand on a wooden floor and draw a line there if you wish. The line can be straight, squiggly, circular. When you are done drawing the line and cast this spell, name a class of creatures (undead, birds, angry fathers) or a specific individual. The line acts as a wall with [Sum] HP against a class of creatures ([Sum]*[dice] HP against an individual).
