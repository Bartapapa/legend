A touched creature treats 1+[dice] portals as equally linked, allowing movement from one to another without taking into consideration distance. A portal here is any threshold that allows movement from one discrete place to another, accessed only by crossing it (such as a door, window or magical portal, but not an iron gate that can be climbed over). When designating the portals, only portals of similar type can be named, and the caster must be able to accurately describe them so that they may be counted for the purposes of the spell (you can say "that door I see over there", or "the window leading to George's bathroom", but not "a red and green door").
