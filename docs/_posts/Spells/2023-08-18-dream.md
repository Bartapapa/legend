When you cast this spell, think of a creature. If they aren't sleeping, this spell doesn't affect them. You create a makeshift dreamscape in which you communicate with them. Describe it briefly. They can talk to you, and you can talk to them for the duration of the spell (which actually only lasts a few seconds in real-time). The creature doesn't initially realize it's in a dream. Intelligent, magically-aware or creatures otherwise trained in protecting their mind might know something is up and wake up prematurely. Language barriers do not affect anyone here.

Once during the duration of the dream, you may implant a suggestion of [sum] words long. When they wake up, they'll remember this suggestion - most will be incentivized to act on it, if it doesn't contradict their beliefs or harm them. Weaker creatures of [dice]/2 HD or less are forced to follow this suggestion unless it is obviously suicidal or harmful to those they hold dear.
