You understand the whining of springs, the whirring of gears, the squeling of hinges, and what their significance is. A door opening from afar can tell you that enemies are coming. A lock may laugh as you tickle its pins. You can speak back to them (although this sounds like clanking and clicking to the uninitiated) and roll Reaction rolls with mechanisms. This doesn't mean that they like you.
