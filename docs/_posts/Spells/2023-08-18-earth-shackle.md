Targets must be touching the ground. For as long as the spell is active, they must keep at least one limb touching the ground at all times. They can jump or run if they make a successful roll +Might with 1 Bane. If a target is knocked prone, they must roll +Might to rise from prone. Targets have a bane on all Grace rolls to dodge.
