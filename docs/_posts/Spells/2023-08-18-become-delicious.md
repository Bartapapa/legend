<b>D:</b> Varies <b>T:</b> Creature of [dice]*2 HD or less <b>R:</b> Touch

Target creature smells and tastes delicious for the spell's duration. The smell radiates 5m in calm air, but can spread via wind or leave a trail. Sentient creatures can usually resist the urge to eat the target without a roll, but animals and other ravenous creatures must roll +Wit or select the spell's target as their primary attack target. Insects will be attracted to the target for the spell's duration. The target may roll +Grace at the end of each duration interval to negate the effects. 1 [dice]: minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: months, 4 [dice] years. This spell can also affect dead creatures.
