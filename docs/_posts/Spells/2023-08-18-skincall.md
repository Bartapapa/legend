You can tear the skin off a creature that you can see. Unwilling creatures can roll a Might save to resist. Their skin is pulled off their flesh and you grab it with your hand, or it flops at their feet. They are unhurt by this, although the experience is horrifying and call for a fear or morale check for anyone spectating. Any armor granted by scales or natural armor is negated for the duration.

Creatures of [dice] HD or less are immediately killed by this. The skin returns to them when the duration ends, unless it was destroyed before, in which case the creature remains skinless (and is vulnerable to all sors of infections and diseases).
