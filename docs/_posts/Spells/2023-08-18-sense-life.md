You feel the life force of any living creature within range. You know their Vigor, as well as if they have any afflictions affecting their body (poisons, cancers, diseases, etc), and their Fatigue. You can't tell which afflictions specifically.

The range changes depending on the [dice] used:
*  1 MD: within hand's reach
*  2 MD: within one stone's toss
*  3 MD: within earshot
*  4 MD: anything closer than the clouds above

<b>Recharge:</b> keep it surrounded by 20 people or more for 4 hours.
