<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> 2m wide line extending from you <b>R:</b> [Dice]*25m

Designate a straight line [dice]x25m long and 2m wide. Anything along the line takes [sum] lightning damage, roll +Grace for half. Up to [dice] targets up to 5m away from the line must also roll +Grace or take half damage. The spell sets small objects on fire and makes a tremendous noise.
