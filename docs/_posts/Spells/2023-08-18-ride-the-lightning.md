<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> Point <b>R:</b> [Dice]km.

You teleport in a flash of lightning, instantly appearing at any point within range. Both your origin and destination must be visible to the sky or connected by a sufficiently conductive item (a wire, a pipe, etc.). Upon arrival, you deal 2d6 lightning damage to all adjacent creatures. For each [dice] you invest past the first, you may bring 1 additional touched target with you when you teleport.
