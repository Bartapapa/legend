<b>D:</b> [Dice] hours <b>T:</b> Point <b>R:</b> Touch

You summon a yellow sponge the size of your head. The sponge can instantly absorb up to [sum]x100L of liquid without growing heavier. You can squeeze the liquid free, but only at the rate of a normal sponge (10L/minute). The sponge can be reused if it is wrung out completely. If you cast this spell with 4 [dice], the sponge lasts for a year and a day, but the spell does not return to your spellbook until the sponge duration expires or the sponge is dispelled. The sponge is impervious to harm caused by the liquids it absorbs.
