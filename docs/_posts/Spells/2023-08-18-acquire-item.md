You reach out with your hand, naming one manufactured item. If any example of such an item exists and it is unattended to, the closest one flies to you, avoiding any obstacles if necessary. If it cannot reach you, it remains pinned or caught, squirming until it can reach your hand or until a minute passes. You can be precise or general with the named item, as long as it's manufactured. You can't call for a broken branch, but you can call for a gemstone. You can call for a red gemstone, or a ruby - but only ones that have been cut and polished are considered manufactured.
