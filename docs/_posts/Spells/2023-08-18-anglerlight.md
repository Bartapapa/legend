A small orb of pulsating light appears floating a few inches from your forehead. This light is immediately visible in darkness and in daylight from up to [dice] kilometers away. Unintelligent living creatures who can see the light are attracted to it, and will seek to meet it. When they are close, they are fascinated by it, until they feel threatened, after which they are unaffected by the spell. Sentient living creatures who see the light and who have [dice] HD or less can roll +Lore to resist these effects.
