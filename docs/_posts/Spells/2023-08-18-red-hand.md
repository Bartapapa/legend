You point a finger at the target and they start writhing in unimaginable agony. The target takes [sum] damage per round and must roll +Might each round to avoid falling prone and losing their turn. You take [dice] damage per round as the skin of your hand slowly flays itself off your flesh. Any damage you suffer from using this spell doesn't prevent you from using that hand, and you incur no risk of infection or bleeding out.
