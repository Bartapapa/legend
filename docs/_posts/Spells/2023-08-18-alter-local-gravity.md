title: Alter local gravity
---
An area of [sum]*2 cubic meters that you specify has its gravity altered either

* an angle that you specify (90 degrees left, 180 degrees up)
or
* to a lower strength that you specify (50%, 0%)

for the duration of the spell. The spell's effect takes place gradually, giving creatures a chance to roll a Grace save to hang on to something or leap out of the area. Creatures take fall damage as normal. In lower gravity, you can jump proportionately higher and farther, but virtually any action requires a +Grace roll. If you invest 4 or more [dice] the spell's duration becomes a year and a day.

<b>Recharge:</b> place in the deepest part of a great mountain for a day.
