title: Alter local gravity
---
<b>D:</b> [Sum] Rounds <b>T:</b> An area of [Sum]*2 cubic meters <b>R:</b> 20m

An area that you specify has its gravity altered either
* an angle that you specify (90 degrees left, 180 degrees up)
or
* to a lower strength that you specify (50%, 0%)
for the duration of the spell. The spell's effect takes place gradually, giving creatures a chance to roll +Grace to hang on to something or leap out of the area. Creatures take fall damage as normal. In lower gravity, you can jump proportionately higher and farther, but virtually any action requires a +Grace roll. If you invest 4 or more [dice] the spell's duration becomes a year and a day.
