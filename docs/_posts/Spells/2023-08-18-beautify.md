<b>D:</b> [Sum] minutes <b>T:</b> Creature <b>R:</b> Touch

An illusory veil covers the creature, adapting to each of its onlookers' gazes. They will seem as beautiful as can be for a creature of their type in the eyes of sentient beholders, according to their sexual preferences, experiences and memories. Beholders particularly affected by beauty must roll +Wit to resist interacting with the target. If [sum] > 12, this effect is permanent.
