This spell can only be cast if the sky is visible from where you stand. Designate a target you can see. The target takes [sum]+[dice] damage, roll Grace save for half. Up to [dice] targets up to 5m away from the line must also roll a Grace save or take half damage. The spell sets small objects on fire and makes a tremendous noise.
