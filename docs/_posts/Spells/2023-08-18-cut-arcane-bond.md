<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> Spell cast with [dice] MD or lower <b>R:</b> 20m

When you cast this spell, you sever the caster's tie to the spell. Any effect that states something to the effect of 'the caster is immune to this effect' is ignored for the remaining duration of the target spell. Things that were summoned, conjured, or controlled by the caster are no more - if they have an intelligence, they use it as they see fit. Otherwise, they remain motionless until the duration expires.
