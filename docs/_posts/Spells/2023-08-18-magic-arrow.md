When casting this spell, throw any object that you can hold in your hand. It automatically deals 1 damage on a target of which you can see the whites of their eyes. If it is even slightly arrow-shaped (stick, needle, blade of grass), it deals [degrees] damage.

<b>Recharge:</b> throw the book and have it land 20 meters away from you.
