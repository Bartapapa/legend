You become unaffected by form. Your skin becomes as deep as the night sky, sparkling with stars deep within - it is as if we could reach into your chest and pluck out one of those hundred lights. If you're underground, the light is dim and your features are still present. In a house or outside during the day, the light brightens, and only traces of what defined you remain. It is only outside at night that you become nigh distinguishable from the sky.

You are unbound by shape, as if but a shadow. You are still affected by physics and may only use your usual modes of movement to displace yourself, but no mundane object has an effect on your body. Only magic can affect you for the duration. You cannot make any sound.
