title: Raindrop cut
---
You cut through a ranged attack, splitting it without being harmed. You need a weapon that can cut to cast this spell.

At 1 [die], you can split arrows or stones flying at you, or stay dry in a rainstorm by deflecting the raindrops with your sword. At 2 [dice], you can cut through a boulder, a ballista bolt or a cannonball. At 3 [dice], you can cut through a splash of liquid, a gust of wind or dragonfire. At 4 [dice], you can split apart spells before they hit you.

You may also cast this spell as a reaction to any ranged attack against you, even outside your turn.
