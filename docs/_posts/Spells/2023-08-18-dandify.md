<b>D:</b> [Dice] hours <b>T:</b> Creature <b>R:</b> Touch

A creature you're touched is immediately propped up to convene to high social standards. Clothes are cleaned, makeup is applied, shirts are straightened, shoes are tied, etc. This spell uses the clothing that the target is currently wearing and makes the most of it. Naked targets are unaffected. For the duration of the spell, the target maintains high-society allure - liquids that would stain do not do so and they slip off fingers and clothes alike as if touching a hydrophobic surface, torn vestments adjust themselves to conceal the tears if possible, a hat that unwillingly falls off is magically swooped back onto the head, etc.
