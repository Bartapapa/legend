You must have at least two working hands to cast this spell. You point at a target with one hand, and point at another with the other. You can transfer heat between them. For example, if you stared at a torch, you could transfer the fire's heat (1d6 damage/round) to a creature. You can do nothing else while casting this spell. You cannot amplify the heat, so a candle's flame cannot melt an iron bar, but you could transfer the icy cold of a glacier to a campfire and extinguish it.
