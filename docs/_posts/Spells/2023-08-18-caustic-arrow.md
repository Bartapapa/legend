You pull an invisible bow and fire off a sickly green arrow which unerringly strikes a target you see. It deals 1d6+[dice] damage on impact. At the start of each of the target's following turns, it delas [dice] damage, ignoring Armor. It keeps dealing this damage until it either deals up to [sum] damage, or the target spends their turn cleaning themselves off.
