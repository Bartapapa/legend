<b>D:</b> [Dice] minutes <b>T:</b> A 1m-wide line extending up to Range <b>R:</b> [Sum] meters

When you open your mouth, a blast of high-speed wind comes out in a line. Any creature caught in the blast of wind must roll +Might to not be blown 5m backwards at the start of each of their turns. Particularly large creatures are only blown 2m away. Creatures smaller than 1m have no roll to resist.
