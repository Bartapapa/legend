<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> Flames or burnt objects <b>R:</b> Touch

You ask [dice] questions to fire or burnt objects. They don't know much, apart from what it was, and anything that happened under its light as it burned. It tries to answer your questions as honestly as possible. Burnt objects are generally weary and shy. Flames are passionnate and loud.
