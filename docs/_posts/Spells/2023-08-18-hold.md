Something that can normally move, can't anymore. No force can act upon it, it cannot take damage, etc. This lasts for [sum] rounds, or until a creature with at least [size] Might rolls a <b>Success</b> when trying to move the target.

<b>Recharge:</b> put it somewhere. Don't let it move for 2 days.
