<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> Metallic object you can see <b>R:</b> 20m

You reach out your hand and designate a metal object. If it is unattended to, it flies at high speed in a straight path towards your hand, crashing into everything along the way - you can avoid it if you wish, although anything behind you needs to roll +Grace. While it is flying, you can orient the object as you wish as long as nothing is stopping it - you can pull a sword out of someone's hand and grab it by the hilt.

The maximum weight of the metal object depends on how many MD you use to cast this spell: 1kg if 1 MD, 10kg if 2 MD, 100kg if 3 MD, 1000kg if 4 MD. If the metal object is worn or held, the creature bearing it can roll +Might to resist this effect.
