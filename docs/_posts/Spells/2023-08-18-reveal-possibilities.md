When casting this spell, you can ask the GM, 'If I do X, what could happen?'. You receive [dice] answers of [sum] words or less each, that are only true in the very specific context in which you are right now. These possibilities reveal themselves to you as visions that transpire before your eyes, which last seconds if not minutes to you, but a fragment of a second to others. If you decide to act immediately on these visions, you have a bane to your next action.
