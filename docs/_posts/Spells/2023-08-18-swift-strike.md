You can perform [dice] bonus attacks on your next turn. If you forgo one of those attacks, you may unsheathe your weapon, attack and sheathe it again so fast all creatures will have to roll a Wit save to notice you even moved.

This spell can also be used to do clothing damage or cut letters on the enemy's skin before they can react.

<b>Recharge:</b> use no weapons for a day.
