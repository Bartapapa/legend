Objects that aren't immediately flammable, but can be, become so - wet wood, leather, etc. Objects that aren't usually flammable and would otherwise melt, now are flammable - metal, rock, etc. Creatures affected by this have no save against catching fire, and have a bane on any subsequent rolls to quench the flames.
