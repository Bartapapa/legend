<b>D:</b> Permanent <b>T:</b> Skull <b>R:</b> Touch

A skull you touch is infused with necromantic energies which rise to the skull's surface. Doing so weakens the skull, and a dark-blue fog continuously seeps from its orbits before dissipating. The skull becomes an Alluring Skull, which takes 1 slot in your Inventory. Any creature that feeds off souls or otherwise can sense souls mistakes the Alluring Skull to be a particuarly fat and juicy soul. The skull can be broken, after which a bluish miasma remains sticking to any close surface for 1d6 rounds, before dissipating.
