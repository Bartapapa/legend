You summon a stone sphere with a diameter of up to [dice]m. The sphere is immensely heavy. 1m radius: 2.5 tons. 2m radius: 22.5 tons. 3m radius: 78 tons. 4m radius: 182 tons. It is perfectly smooth and very difficult to lift. You must summon the stone onto a stable surface. For example, you can't summon it by touching water or sand, but you could summon it on top of a flimsy wooden railing. If you invest 3 or more [dice], you can make the spell's duration permanent
