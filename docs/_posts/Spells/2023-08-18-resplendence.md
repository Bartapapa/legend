You are bathed in an otherworldly fiery golden light. You shed light as a torch, reaching up to [dice]*5m. Sentient creatures of [dice]/2 HD that can see you cower, flee or kneel depending on their attitude towards the divine. Before the duration is up, you can dismiss this effect in a flash of light, blinding creatures of [dice] HD in range even if they close their eyes for [sum] turns. If [sum] > 12, this blindness is permanent.
