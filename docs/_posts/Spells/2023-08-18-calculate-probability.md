When casting this spell, you can ask the GM [dice] questions following the structure, 'What's the probability of X happening (if I do Y)?'. You receive an honest answer from the GM's part, which can be a percentile (50%), or a dice chance (1-in-6, 7-in-20).

<b>Recharge:</b> find an acorn, give it a name of 8 different characters (numbers can be used - it doesn't need to make sense), and plant it where there are no other trees.
