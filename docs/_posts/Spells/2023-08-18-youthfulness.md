<b>D:</b> [Sum] minutes <b>T:</b> Creature or organic matter <b>R:</b> Touch

A creature's body is envigored by youth for the duration. This isn't an illusion, but an actual reversion of age. This doesn't, however, make the target any younger - it makes old muscles become firm, dented scales righten, tired eyes sharpen. If [sum] > 12, then these effects are permanent.

If organic matter is targeted, such as leather or wood, the effects of time are reverted - cracked leather repairs itself, warped wood straightens.
