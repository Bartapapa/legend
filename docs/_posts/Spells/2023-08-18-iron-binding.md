An iron chain [dice]*5m long erupts from a point you touch. You can choose to have one end bolted to a solid surface. When the chain emerges you can use it to tie something within its length up with a Grace save. After the spell runs out the chains crumble to rusty dust.

<b>Recharge:</b> wrap a chain around the book and bind it to your hand holding the book for a day.
