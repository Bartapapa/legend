<b>D:</b> [Sum] minutes <b>T:</b> Self <b>R:</b> Self

You speak the language of stars, which cannot be heard but seen. Any time you speak for the duration, the dull sound of bass through an aquarium window is heard to all those who could normally hear you. However, when you do so, flickers and flashes of light erupt from your mouth. You have a Light score of [dice] (allowing you to properly illuminate [dice]-1 other people, since you illuminate yourself first), and radiate light up to [dice]*5m.

If 2 MD are used to cast this spell, you can dispel it in a flash of light as you speak a prophecy in the tongue of stars. Anyone who knows how to read constellations can know what you say. Speak a prophecy of [sum] words or less - <i>this prophecy will happen</i>. It is up to the GM to interpret it. When speaking a prophecy, you cannot speak any proper nouns (specific places, specific names, etc) nor designate any specific thing (that tree, this person, etc), although general titles work fine (the warlord, she who banishes night, etc).
