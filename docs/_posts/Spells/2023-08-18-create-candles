<b>D:</b> 3 hours <b>T:</b> Object <b>R:</b> Touch

Your fingers become waxy and white. [Sum] dribbly candles appear on objects you touch. You can walk around placing candles as required, for up to 5 minutes. The candles are lit and burn for 3 hours. They can be detached, but will fade from existence within 5 minutes. If any spells are cast within an area illuminated by a summoned candle, the candle's flame will turn blue and point to the caster.
