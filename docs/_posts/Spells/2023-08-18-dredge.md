<b>D:</b> Varies <b>T:</b> Sentient creature or area of [sum] square meters <b>R:</b> 20m

If you target an area, uried or covered objects rise to the surface in the area you designate over 1 minute. If you cast this spell on the ground, coins, stones, and roots will be pulled to the surface. If you cast it on water, sunken objects will rise to the surface and remain there as long as you maintain concentration. The total weight of dredged objects cannot exceed [dice]x100lbs.

If you target a creature, the creature must roll +Wit (if unwilling) or recall a memory in perfect detail. You designate the memory ("the first time you met your wife", "where you buried the treasure"). The creature will be lost in a reverie for [sum] rounds. This reverie ends if the creature is attacked, threatened, or has to perform any action. This memory may induce a Fear or Morale test. It must be specific. "The scariest thing you have ever seen" would not work, but "the night your village burned" would. This can be used to force a creature to recover a Mind-Scar it once lost.
