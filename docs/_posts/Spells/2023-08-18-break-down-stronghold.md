You are suffused with the power of strong ideals, which chips at people's philosophical resolve in spoken conflict. When in a debate or in an argument for the duration of this spell, your sheer charisma and force of conviction is enough to make anyone back down. Creatures with no strong convictions stay clear of you or meet your demands, as you choose. Creatures with strong ideals and philosophies can be convinced by your rhetoric if they couldn't be before. You can reroll Reaction rolls with a bonus of +[dice]. If using the Keys & Locks system, you can ignore up to [dice] Locks, even if they were already triggered.
