Iridescent fragments of arcane energy coalesce around you, following your every movement. You have [Dice] Armor for the duration, unless you already had more. You may choose to destroy 1 such Armor in this way to reduce the damage of a mundane attack by 1d6. You can increase this by choosing to destroy additional Armor.
