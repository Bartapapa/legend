title: Poison sting
---
The fingers from one of your hands fuses together, becoming like a large scorpion stinger. A noxious poison drips from the end. You may attack with the stinger, dealing 1d6 damage and inflicting <i>Scorpion poison</i> on your target, dealing 1d6 damage every round until the effect wears off or the target successfuly saves. They can roll a Might save to resist the effect initially, and at the start of each of their turns. You can sting up to [dice] times, after which the spell is expended.
