<b>D:</b> Permanent <b>T:</b> Object (cloth) <b>R:</b> Touch

By dictating descriptions of your heroic deeds, you can cause a tapestry to sew itself into cloth you provide. The cloth can be as small as a handkerchief or as large as a house's wall. The deeds must focus on you and your actions, but other characters can be added in, as required by the story. It takes [dice] hours of work to dictate the tale, and if you are interrupted, you must Save or the spell fails.

If 1 [dice] is used, then the value of the created object is Trash. If 2 [dice], it is Mundane. If 3 [dice], Valuable, and if 4 [dice], Treasure. 

The object created does not count towards leveling up when used for carousing.
