You create a spiraling labyrinth of thought in your mind. Anyone attempting to read your mind or cast a memory-altering spell must roll +Wit or become trapped in the labyrinth - they take up 1 slot in your Mind, and their body becomes unconscious while they're in there. Once per hour, they can roll +Wit to escape. Very experienced mind readers may expend a [die] to automatically escape in 1d10 minutes. While a creature is trapped in your mind, you can distantly hear its thoughts.
