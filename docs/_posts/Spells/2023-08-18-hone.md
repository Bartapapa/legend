You run your hands over a metal or wooden edge and hone it. The object becomes razor sharp. Blunt objects deal 1d6 damage. Piercing or bladed weapons deal an extra 1d6 damage for the next [dice]x2 hits. The edge must be smaller than your outstretched arms.

<b>Recharge:</b> place a blade in between its pages, and break the blade clean off.
