This spell can only be cast if you have Wounds due to exhaustion. You bundle your exhaustion into a ball and toss it at a creature. You must make an attack roll to hit an unwilling creature. You lose [dice] Wounds (up to the maximum of Exhaustion Wounds you have), and on a successful attack, you deal [dice]*2 damage. The creature may take on some aspects of your personality, momentarily.
