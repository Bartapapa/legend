Target creature's hair flees it's body in a sudden, painful burst. The target is stunned for 1 round and takes 1d6 damage. Roll +Might to negate. Creatures that prize their hair, such as dwarves or lionfolk, may need to make roll +Wit against a fear effect. The target's hair will regrow at the normal rate. This spell has no effect on hairless creatures or creatures immune to pain.
