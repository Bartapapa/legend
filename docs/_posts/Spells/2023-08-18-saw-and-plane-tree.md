<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> One tree (one saw) <b>R:</b> Touch

Touch a saw, and a tree no larger than 60' tall and 25' in diameter. It topples over, as if neatly cut. The result depends on the dice you invest. 1 [dice]: cut and broadly de-limbed, 2 [dice]: cut, de-limbed, debarked, 3 [dice]: cut, de-limbed, debarked, cut into planks as per your specifications, stacked, 4 [dice] cut, planed, de-limbed, debarked, cut into planks, stacked, sanded, and finished. Small limbs and offcuts will be piled for kindling. Alternatively, you can reduce the tree to sawdust or wood chips in 24-[sum] minutes
