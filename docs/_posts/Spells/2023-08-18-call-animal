<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> Self <b>R:</b> [Sum] km

When you acquire this spell, the GM randomly assigns an [animal] to it. All instances of [animal] are replaced by it.

You emit a call that is only heard by [animal]s, along with a simple, obvious command of up to [sum] words. The closest [animal] to your location, if there are any, complete the command to the best of their ability before reporting back to you. If they cannot reach you in a day's time, they will not report back.
