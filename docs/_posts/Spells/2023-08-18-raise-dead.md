title: Raise dead

Target is raised as a specific type of undead that is obedient to the caster. The creature is animated by a specially developed spell or an obedient ghost. When the spellâ€™s duration ends, the undead may collapse, and cannot be raised again or used for any further spells.

  The type of undead raised depends on the target and the [dice] invested.
  *  1 [die] : 1-2 HD creature : corpse snake, crawling claw, skeleton, zombie
  *  2 [dice] : 1-4 HD creature : wight
  *  3 [dice] : 1-6 HD creature : war spirit, mummy
  *  4 [dice] : 1-8 HD creature : something impressively terrifying

  Undead typically have reduced stats compared to their living form. Undead of 5 HD or less are nearly mindless. If you die while undead are under your control, the spell's duration expires, or you try to end the spell, there is a [HD]-in-10 chance the undead remains active. Otherwise, it collapses.

  Instead of letting the spell expire, you can keep the [dice] you spent on the spell invested. The spell's duration becomes permanent as long as those [dice] remain invested. Alternatively, if you spend 4 [dice] to raise a 1 or 2 HD creature, the spell's duration becomes permanent and no [dice] need to be invested. Creatures may retain some special abilities they had in life.
