<b>D:</b> [Dice] rounds <b>T:</b> Self <b>R:</b> Line of sight

You can declare up to [dice] locations you can see where you are at the same time. You are not visible in these places, but you can only move as if you were in all of these places at the same time. You feel everything you should as if you were in those places. Any equipment you have on you acts as if it were worn or used in those locations. If you are falling and you declare you're on the ground below you, you land on the ground, while you're still in the air. You can open a door from afar by moving as if a door were in front of you. You can swing a sword at one enemy, and have multiple enemies struck by the same blade.

This, of course, is also applicable in reverse. Anything that happens to the places where you should be happens also to you. Areas of effect affect you only once.

If you want to die, cast this spell while declaring you're on the surface of the Sun.
