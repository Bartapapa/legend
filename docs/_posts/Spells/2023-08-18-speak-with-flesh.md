title: Speak with flesh
---
You touch a fresh corpse (which still has most of its flesh) or a sleeping creature. Its flesh soul awakens to answer [dice] questions, although the flesh soul only knows about things the flesh would know - physical stimuli, heat, muscle memories, etc. It answers as best it possibly can, however its knowledge remains limited for many other things. This doesn't wake sleeping creatures.

Once cast, cannot be cast on the same creature or corpse again before a week passes.

<b>Recharge:</b> let it sit in the fleshy ribcage of a creature for a day.
