title: Collect memory
---
You pull a single memory out of the head of a creature you touch. If the creature is unwilling, they can roll a Wit save to resist. The memory must be short, and it must be distinct - it must be described in [sum] words or less. You must place the memory in a clean glass bottle, otherwise it'll dissipate (or get dirty, which muddles the memory). The target loses this memory. You can put the memory in another target's head.

<b>Recharge:</b> tell the spellbook one of your innermost secrets that it doesn't know about.
