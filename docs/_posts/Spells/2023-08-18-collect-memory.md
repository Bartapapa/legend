<b>D:</b> Varies <b>T:</b> Creature <b>R:</b> Touch

You pull a single memory out of the head of a creature you touch. If the creature is unwilling, you need to succeed on an attack roll to touch them. The memory must be short, and it must be distinct. You can put the memory into someone else's head, which takes up 1 slot in their Mind (their soul realizes it's not their memory, and has a hard time organizing it with the rest). The memory is perfectly vivid for [sum] days but begins to fade after that. If [sum] is greater than 12, the memory will never fade, even if the target loses all other memories.

You can transfer Mind-Scars this way, although those will always never fade.
