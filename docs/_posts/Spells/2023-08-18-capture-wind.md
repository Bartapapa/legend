<b>D:</b> Concentration <b>T:</b> Point <b>R:</b> Touch

A magical circle [dice]x2' in radius extends from your fingertip. As long as you maintain concentration, you can absorb any wind passing through the circle. You can then collapse the spell into a wind cube, taking up 1 slot in your Inventory. At any point, you can reactivate it with the same radius (no [dice] are needed) to release the wind you absorbed, destroying the cube. The wind flows out at the same rate it entered. If you activate this spell in a light breeze for 5 minutes, the spell will release a light breeze over 5 minutes. The wind only flows from the circle, so anyone standing behind it is not affected (unless you release hurricane-force winds indoors). You can cancel the release at any time, which expends the spell as usual. If the cube breaks (it's about as hard as crystal), it activates facing a random direction.
