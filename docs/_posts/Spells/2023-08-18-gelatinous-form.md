<b>D:</b> [Sum] minutes <b>T:</b> Self <b>R:</b> Self

Your flesh becomes gelatinous. You can squeeze through gaps as small as keyhole with a great deal of effort. You take no damage from bludgeoning weapons for the duration of the spell. Any acid damage you take heals HP instead. Your clothes and items are not affected by this spell. If [sum] > 12, you're mindless for the duration.

> Some people think that this spells calls upon druidism, which makes oozes beasts.
> They're not wrong, but they lack the understanding of a few details.
> Oozes aren't just beasts. They're the <b>first</b> beasts.
