<b>D:</b> [Dice] hours <b>T:</b> Creature or object <b>R:</b> Touch

An object of your choice is banded in smoking metal, giving it [sum] HP that has to be removed before it can be damaged. This also works on creatures made of inorganic materials, like constructs. If cast multiple times on the same target, only the highest bonus is taken.
