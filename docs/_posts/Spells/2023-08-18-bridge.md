title: Bridge
---
A shimmering bridge of force appears from an object the caster touches, and extends, perfectly level, in a single direction, to a maximum distance of [sum]*4 meters. Both ends of the bridge must touch solid objects. The bridge is 1' wide and thin as a sheet of paper. Slowly walking across it does not require a Grace save, but running or a slight breeze will require one. The bridge shatters if it is dealt any damage.

<b>Recharge:</b> cross 10 different bridges with the book in your hands.
