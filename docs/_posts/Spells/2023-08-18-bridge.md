A shimmering bridge of force appears from an object the caster touches, and extends, perfectly level, in a single direction. Both ends of the bridge must touch solid objects. The bridge is 1' wide and thin as a sheet of paper. Slowly walking across it does not require a Save vs Dexterity, but running or a slight breeze will require one. The bridge shatters if it is dealt any damage.
