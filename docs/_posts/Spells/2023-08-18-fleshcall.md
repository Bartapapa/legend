<b>D:</b> Concentration <b>T:</b> Creature of [dice] HD or less <b>R:</b> 20m

You can temporarily tear the flesh soul out of a living creature or a recently deceased creature, taking up 1 slot in your Mind. If living, the creature can make a +Might roll to resist this effect. Else, the creature falls prone, incapable of moving, speaking, breathing, or beating their heart. If the target doesn't reacquire their flesh soul in the following 4 rounds, they die.

While you have the flesh soul in your mind, you gain knowledge of anything the flesh would know - muscle memories, flesh feelings, etc. Once you drop concentration, the flesh soul either returns to its original bearer if it is alive or recently dead, or it dissipates into nothingness and the corpse's flesh immediately rots and decays.
