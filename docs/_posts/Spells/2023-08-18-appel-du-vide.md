You remove a creature's survival instinct. Unwilling creatures get to roll +Lore to resist. In effect, the creature doesn't realize what may harm them or even kill them. They're not stupid, so they won't jump off a cliff if they don't believe that doing so won't accomplish what they seek. Any effect that states something to the effect of '... except if that would lead to harm or the death of the creature' is ignored for the duration of this spell.

This doesn't affect creatures who have no sense of damage to their form, like unintelligent undead.
