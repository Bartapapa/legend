You ask a lesser spirit for guidance. Ask one question of [sum] words maximum. While you don't have an answer to the question, as long as you ask it aloud, you'll get the feeling of a direction, of an object or of a person around you. Lesser spirits aren't very smart, and they don't necessarily know the intricacies of your situation, and may guide you to a lake of lava because on the other side of it is a peninsula where it wants you to go, instead of guiding you all around the lake. It might lead you to someone who wants to kill you.
