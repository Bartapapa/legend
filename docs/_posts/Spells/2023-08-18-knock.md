You knock on a closed object, forcing it open with a loud bang. This works on doors, windows, chests, etc.

If used on someone's head and they have less than [sum] Wit, they will immediately tell you their first thoughts.

<b>Recharge:</b> put the book in a locked container, and retrieve it without unlocking it.
