You manifest an [dice]m radius sphere of water at a point, capturing creatures and objects within. Unwilling targets can roll +Grace to dodge out of the way before it manifests. You can use your action to slowly move the orb along the ground, and it will roll over obstacles smaller than it - trapped objects and creatures are rolled along with the orb. The orb pushes away objects and creatures in its path harmlessly as it moves around. The targets cannot breathe in the sphere, unless usually able to breathe underwater, but they can move within the confines of the orb and attack as if they were in water.
