An arcane hole appears at a designated point. If any spell is cast or passes by the hole within 10m of it, the spell is swallowed by the hole. It can swallow up to [sum] Magic dice worth of spells. If it gathers too many MD before its duration is up, it collapses upon itself, sending an aetheric shockwave which travels up to [gathered MD]*10 meters. Any creature with Magic dice that is caught within the blast loses the die. If the duration reaches its end without it swallowing too many MD, it dissipates harmlessly.
