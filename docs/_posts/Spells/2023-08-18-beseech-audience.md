<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> Upper being <b>R:</b> Earshot

Within earshot of a representation of an upper being (such as a statue, a painting, or even a symbol), you may call upon it to ask [dice] questions to them. You must know one of their names or titles to be able to do so. You are instantly transported to their domain, in front of them. The GM may ask for a Reaction roll to see how they react to you - you have a +1 cumulative bonus to this roll if you've done something good for them in the past, or you've sacrificed an animal as part of the casting of this spell. The opposite applies as well.

They are in no way forced to answer your question in any way that is helpful to you, and can send you back from whence you came if they so please. If you properly pissed them off, they'll send a death squad after you.

If you know their <b>True name</b>, they cannot refuse, and must answer your questions truthfully before sending you back.
