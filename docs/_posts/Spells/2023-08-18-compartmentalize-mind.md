title: Compartmentalize mind - REWORK
---
<b>D:</b> [Dice] hours <b>T:</b> Creature <b>R:</b> Touch

You attempt to compartmentalize a creature's mind. Doing so reorganizes their Mind with efficiency that no biology can reproduce, creating an additional [dice] Mind slots for the duration. The target then chooses which of their current Mind items are transferred to the new slots. This creates an entirely new Mind for the user, and the user must choose which one is activated at any time. They can take 1 round to activate the other Mind, deactivating the previous one. Generally, their personality doesn't change much when doing so. When one Mind isn't activated, the user cannot use those items, although the user isn't affected by the items either in any way (if their Mind-Scars are displaced into their second mind and the first is activated, they count as having 0 Mind-Scars).

If cast with 3 [dice] or more, you can make the duration permanent. If this spell is cast on someone who already has this effect, they lose their additional Mind slots, and randomly lose certain mind items as they are gobbled up by the subconscious.
