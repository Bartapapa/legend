Your hand, or an item you touch, glows like a flame in the dark. It acts as a light. You can dispel the light, flashing it brilliantly - anyone looking at the light is blinded for [sum] minutes. If [sum] > 12, the blindness is permanent until the stars can look down at them from above.

<b>Recharge:</b> leave in absolute darkness for 2 nights.
