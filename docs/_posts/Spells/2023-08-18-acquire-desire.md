title: Acquire desire - REWORK
---
<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> Creature <b>R:</b> 5m

You get a feel for the creature's desires and wants in its life. When you cast this spell, you understand [dice] desires of the target, chosen randomly by the GM. Ones you don't already know yet are prioritized. If you're playing with a Locks & Keys system, the GM can give you Keys for the effects of this spell.

If using 2 [dice] or more, you can capture up to as many desires as you detect via this spell (or know that the target already has) and lock them away in your Mind, taking up 1 slot. Unwilling creatures can roll +Wit to resist this effect. When you cast this spell again using 2 [dice] or more, you can choose to transfer desires you've kept in your Mind to the target - unwilling targets can roll +Wit to resist this effect.
