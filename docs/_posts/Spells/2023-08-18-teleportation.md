<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> Point (varies) <b>R:</b> Touch

You and up to [dice] creatures you touch are transported to a point within range. The maximum range is determined by the amount of [dice] used. You need to do a +Grace attack roll to touch unwilling creatures. You must either see your destination or be able to accurately describe it ("right there", "the Golden city of Lomok", "in the giant's belly").

*  1 MD range: [Sum] meters.
*  2 MD range: [Sum]*100 meters.
*  3 MD range: [Sum]*10 kilometers.
*  4 MD range: Anywhere you can see or describe.

On a Mishap, you (and everyone you went with) teleport somewhere near within 1 [range] of your chosen point (not necessarily the same spot). If using 4 MD, everybody is teleported to the place where they were born. There's a 3-in-6 chance that someone gets splinched, taking [sum] damage.
