title: Teleportation
---
You and up to [dice] creatures you touch are transported to a point within range. The maximum range is determined by the amount of [dice] used. Unwilling creatures can make a Grace save to not be affected. You must either see your destination or be able to accurately describe it ("right there", "the Golden city of Lomok", "in the giant's belly").

*  1 MD range: [Sum] meters.
*  2 MD range: [Sum]*100 meters.
*  3 MD range: [Sum]*10 kilometers.
*  4 MD range: Anywhere you can see or describe.

On a Mishap, you (and everyone you went with) teleport somewhere near within 1 [range] of your chosen point (not necessarily the same spot). If using 4 MD, everybody is teleported to the place where they were born. There's a 3-in-6 chance that someone gets splinched in the case of a mishap, taking [sum] damage.

<b>Recharge:</b> if the last Notch on this spellbook is crossed, the spellbook doesn't teleport with you. It'll be at the place where you telepored from, recharged.
