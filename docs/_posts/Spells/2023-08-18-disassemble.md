title: Disassemble
---
One manufactured object disassembles itself in front of you, organizing its pieces into neat piles. The complexity of the object that can be disassembled depends on the amount of MD used to cast the spell.

*  1 MD: simple technology - spear held with rope, table.
*  2 MD: moderate technology - objects with many steps to its construction, swords, carriages.
*  3 MD: complex technology - peak of engineering, automatic crossbows, first train locomotives.
*  4 MD: alien high-technology - indistinguishable from magic, ray guns, usb keys.

<b>Recharge:</b> put back together something disassembled by this spell, without any help.
