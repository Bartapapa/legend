<b>D:</b> [Sum] minutes <b>T:</b> Creature <b>R:</b> Touch

The touched target's legs lengthen by [dice] meters. This doesn't change the structure of the leg, just one of its dimensions. If the target is unwilling, you need to roll an attack roll to touch it. Affected creatures are disoriented and their speed is halved for 1d6 rounds, then increased by +[dice] meters thereafter.
