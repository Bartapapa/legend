When this spell is acquired, the GM randomly determines an animal. All instances of [animal] are replaced by this.

The target becomes an [animal] for the duration. If the target is unwilling, it can resist by rolling +Might. The target benefits from all advantages and drawbacks the animal would have - its atributes are unaffected, although they can only act insofar as the animal could do so. If you're transformed into a dog with a Wit of 2, it doesn't mean you can do calculus. If [sum] > 12, this effect is permanent.
