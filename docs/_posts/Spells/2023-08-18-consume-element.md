title: Consume [element]
---
<b>D:</b> Instantaneous <b>T:</b> [element] <b>R:</b> Touch

When you first acquire this spell, the GM replaces any instance of [element] with an element or material of their choice. For quick reference, fire, earth, water, air, acid and lightning are some elements.

You can cast this as a reaction to someone using [element], if you are in range. You consume [sum] of an element in one mouthful. If the [element] would normally deal less damage than [sum], it is entirely consumed (for example, torches deal 1d6 fire damage normally). If the element is not something that innately deals damage (such as earth, water or air) you consume [sum] litres of it. Creatures made of [element] take [sum] damage.

If [sum] > 6, this counts as a ration for the day.
