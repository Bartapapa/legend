<b>D:</b> 10 rounds <b>T:</b> [Dice] corpses or undead <b>R:</b> 20m

You conjure a swarm of insects that quickly devours the flesh off [dice] corpses or undead. If it is undead, it deals 1d6 damage per round until the spell ends. Applying area of effect fire damage or spending an action burning away the insects stops this effect.

If 2 [dice] or more are used, you can target living creatures. Living creatures can spend their action swatting away the insects to not receive damage. Being eaten alive is nevertheless horrifying, and can call for a Morale check or fear resistance.

If 3 [dice] or more are used, you can target any organic matter, so long as it is human-sized or less.
