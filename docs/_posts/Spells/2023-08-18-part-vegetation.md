You bring your hand high up in the air, and bring it down in a direction you choose. All plantlife and vegetation in range displaces itself harmlessly to clear a path, removing any difficult terrain generated by it. Plant creatures can roll +Wit to resist this effect - if they don't resist, they must remain to the side for the duration, although they can freely move on that side.
