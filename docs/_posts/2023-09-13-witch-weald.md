<h2>Advice for GMs</h2>
If this is your first time reading an adventure to play, then welcome! Hopefully this will teach you some basic tools and give you tips on how to manage certain situations. This adventure can be taken as-is without any modifications on your part - but if you want it to cater to a different atmosphere, world or location, go right ahead! Part of GMing is 'hacking' things that are already written and making the changes you think are the best for your group.

<h2>How to use this</h2>
In order to properly use this adventure site, go ahead and read it in its entirety - just like in the real world, there are various areas and people who will be affected by the player characters' actions, so it's necessary for you to know what certain things will do in this portion of the land.

You can keep this page open as a tab in your phone for easy access, or you can download the PDF <u>here</u>. If you download it, you can also print out the pages XX, YY and ZZ because you'll be needing them for a quick reference. Remember that as a GM, you totally have the right to change everything that's in here, remove some, add in more, and generally make it yours. It's actually a good exercise to do so! So read up, change a few things, and you've got an adventure site that'll be different from any other made up until now.
