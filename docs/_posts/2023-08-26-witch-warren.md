## Advice for GMs
If this is your first time reading an adventure to play, then welcome! Hopefully this will teach you some basic tools and give you tips on how to manage certain situations. This adventure can be taken as-is without any modifications on your part - but if you want it to cater to a different atmosphere, world or location, go right ahead! Part of GMing is 'hacking' things that are already written and making the changes you think are the best for your group.

In general, for this adventure,
*  Read through it entirely, to have an idea of what it's about until the end.
*  List the things you don't like, or don't mesh with your world. Replace them with other things.
*  Print the context information, maps, character information, as well as the tables.

## Context
Thrushvale is a small village of around 100 inhabitants, situated at the edge of the duchy's territory, right south of the mountain range separating it from the Barking Baronnies. To the west of it is a small forest that the villagers would go to - children, woodsmen and frolicking lovers. However, since several weeks now, Thrushvale has suffered recently, as the small river used to spin the watermill has gone dry, and not but a week after, a witch took residence in it, transforming villagers who wander into the woods into toads!

Without the mill working, the villagers will have a hard time making food for the upcoming winter, and they can't see what's going on with the river upstream due to the witch. Not only that, but the town mayor has been turned into a toad, and he looks as if he's about to croak.

Here are some reasons why the different factions could take an interest in Thrushvale's predicament:
  
*  <b>Cats:</b> when the mayor left for the forest, he brought with him his shiny golden pendant. When he came back, he didn't have it anymore - it was surely taken by the witch, and you can go grab it for yourself.
*  <b>Dogs:</b> the dog barons sent you to help the farmers of Thrushvale, who are too far into the wilds of the duchy to be adequately helped.
*  <b>Crows:</b> the fireflies called upon the Firefly Accord to send you to investigate the forest, as they're too scared to venture in after the disappearance of the last scouting force sent there.
*  <b>Rabbits:</b> these are all new people to meet, and there's surely an interesting story to tell after you deal with whatever's going on here.
*  <b>Rats:</b> by helping the villagers of Thrushvale, you also show that the Tabby duke is an inadequate protector of their own lands.
*  <b>Moles:</b> other moles have determined that the dried-up river is an artesian well - now that it's dry, this could be an opportunity to explore its galleries underground once the danger is cleared.
*  <b>Boars:</b> the bugs of Thrushvale forest have all but disappeared. Investigate what is going on and put a stop to it.

<p>Having reasons why one or more characters of the group are interested in doing the adventure, you also have a direct reason as to why they're all together in the first place. Don't stop your players from coming up with their own ideas as to why they're in Thrushvale - perhaps the miller's a friend, or a parent calls upon an uncle or aunt to find a way to turn the children back into what they were before.</p>

## Locations

### Thrushvale
A small town of around 100 inhabitants situated right at the north-western border of the Duchy, next to the Barking Baronnies. Its population is mostly cats from the Duchy, but there are several dogs who hail from the baronnies, as well as a few crows, rats and rabbits. The entire town is situated on the slope of a large hill at the foot of a mountain, right next to a river that strolls down, normally spinning a watermill. Right now, all that's left of it is dry mud and stone.

### Thrushvale forest
The river that crosses Thrushvale goes through this forest, although it digs into the limestone below and disappears beneath roots and stone near where it enters this forest from the mountain's side. It only reappears near the edge of the eastern part of the forest, where it normally runs down to where Thrushvale is.

### Claypeak range
The river that crosses Thrushvale takes its source here, from a waterfall visible on the other side of the mountain, which is a few days' walk from Thrushvale.

### Witch's warren
Situated a couple of hours away from the town, Zaggy the witch has taken residence in a burrow of her own making, of which the entrance is right underneath he roots of a large oak tree with great big acorns, that she gathers to cook some food for herself. A few meters away from the entrance is a buzzing beehive made of wood and bark, home to a couple hundred bumblebees, some of them as big as the character's thumbs.

Inside is warm and moist, and actually pretty comfortable with nice wooden furniture that is well-kept, even if there are some mold stains on the wood from the humidity. The interior is well-lit during the night, although Zaggy turns the lights off before she goes to sleep.

### Toad tunnels
The toad tunnels are far too humid, and stink of frog poo. There's a constant wetness to the walls, which feel just as slimy and bumpy as a toad's skin. They're constantly dark inside.
