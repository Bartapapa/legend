## Advice for GMs
If this is your first time reading an adventure to play, then welcome! Hopefully this will teach you some basic tools and give you tips on how to manage certain situations. This adventure can be taken as-is without any modifications on your part - but if you want it to cater to a different atmosphere, world or location, go right ahead! Part of GMing is 'hacking' things that are already written and making the changes you think are the best for your group.
