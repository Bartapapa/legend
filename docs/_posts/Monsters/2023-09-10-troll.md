## Special

### Fear of bells
Trolls hate the sound of bells. If they hear a bell chiming in their proximity, their morale is reduced to 8. If the bell is a large bell weighing a ton or more, it is further reduced by 2. If the bell is attached to a church, it is further reduced by 2. If the bell bears all of these caracteristics, the trolls fail the morale check and flee to where they cannot hear the bell.

## Keys & Locks
Trolls <b>love</b> food, especially exotic delicacies - the slimier, the better. They also <b>seek to destroy</b> organized religion, and their preferred method of doing that is throwing meter-large stones to break down the walls of places of worship.
