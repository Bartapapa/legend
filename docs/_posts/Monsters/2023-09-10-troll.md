## Statistics

<b>Hit dice:</b> 6d6+4 (25 HP)
<b>Armor:</b> 1
<b>Attributes:</b> Wit +1 (11)
<b>Morale:</b> 10 (7 fear of fire)
<b>Attacks:</b> 2 claws (1d6 each) //or// 1 bite (1d10)

## Special

### Regeneration
The troll regenerates 2 HP at the start of each of its turns. If reduced to 0 HP, it returns to 1 HP 2d6 rounds after. Hacked-off limbs will continue moving on their own, aiming to reattach themselves to their original body. A troll that has been damaged by fire or acid in the last minute does not regenerate - this is the only way to truly kill a troll.

### Fear of fire
Trolls hate fire. Their Morale score is 7 if they know fire is around or can be used against them.
