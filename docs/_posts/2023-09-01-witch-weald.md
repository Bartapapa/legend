<small>This is an adventure suitable for beginner players 10 years old and up, and beginner GMs.</small>

<h2>Advice for GMs</h2>
If this is your first time reading an adventure to play, then welcome! Hopefully this will teach you some basic tools and give you tips on how to manage certain situations. This adventure can be taken as-is without any modifications on your part - but if you want it to cater to a different atmosphere, world or location, go right ahead! Part of GMing is 'hacking' things that are already written and making the changes you think are the best for your group.

<blockquotegm><p>Things that are written like this are bits of advice specifically for you.</p></blockquotegm>

For this adventure,
*  Read through it entirely, to have an idea of what it's about until the end.
*  List the things you don't like, or don't mesh with your world. Replace them with other things.
*  Print the context information, maps, character information, as well as the tables, from the >>PDF<<.
