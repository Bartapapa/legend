Monsters is a catch-all term hat designates any creature that represents a threat to player characters and who has stats for combat. Kobolds, bandits and giant maneating worms can all be considered monsters.

Monsters don't follow exactly the same rules as player characters. Monsters have a quantity of <b>Hit dice</b> (or <b>HD</b>), which are d6s, that determines their HP once rolled. A monster who falls to 0 HP dies. Generally, stats aren't marked for monsters - by default, consider that they have a bonus to all stats equal to their HD, and a defense equal to their HD+10. This can of course be altered by the GM if it doesn't make sense.

A monster also has a <b>Morale</b> score. Morale is rolled whenever something terrifying happens, or when the monsters are reduced to half their original number (or half health, if they're only 1). This is a score that is between 2 (for cowardly monsters) and 12 (for monsters that have almost no fear of death). Some mindless monsters don't have a morale score, and so are unaffected by such things.
