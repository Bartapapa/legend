<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of six-sided dice (or <b>d6s</b>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky, the GM can ask them to <b>roll 2d6</b>, called a <b>challenge roll</b>. The results are added together, and compared to the following:
*  <b>6 or less</b> - <i>Failure</i>. The character doesn't manage to do what they intended, and something bad happens.
*  <b>between 7 and 9</b> - <i>Partial success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, but something bad happens.
*  <b>10 or more</b> - <i>Success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended.
*  <b>Two '6's</b> - <i>Great success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, and something good happens.

Sometimes, a <b>modifier</b> is applied to the roll - generally, it is one of the character's <b>attributes</b> depending on what the character is trying to do.

Certain situations can grant <b>boons</b> or <b>banes</b>. These are additional d6 that are rolled during a challenge roll. In the case of a boon, the player takes the best two results - in the case of a bane, they take the worst two. There can be more than one bane or boon. Banes and boons cancel each other out on a 1-by-1 basis.

That's all!

<summary><b>Create a character</b></summary>
A character starts with 0 in all of 4 main attributes. This can change with the choice of Class and Background.

A character also starts with 6 <b>Hit Points</b> (or <b>HP</b>), 10 <b>Inventory</b> slots and 10 <b>Mind</b> slots.

Choose your character's <b>Class</b>, and get its <b>Starting equipment</b> in your inventory and its <b>Starting savvies</b> in your mind.
Choose your character's <b>Background</b>, as well as one or two <b>Goals</b> - the GM will reward you for following these.

You're done!

<summary><b>Attributes, Stats and Savvies</b></summary>

A character has 4 <b>main attributes</b>:
*  <u><b>Might.</b></u> This is sheer physical strength, hardiness, resistance to pain. Generally used to break down doors, crush a skull, and holding one's breath.
*  <u><b>Grace.</b></u> This is agility, quickness and reactivity. Generally used to run across tightropes, play the piano, and ride beasts.
*  <u><b>Wit.</b></u> This is thinking quickly, perception and charm. Generally used to sense when being observed, compel a guard to look the other way or swipe the noble's purse.
*  <u><b>Lore.</b></u> This is understanding, education and breadth of knowledge. Generally used to calculate hypergeometry, know dining etiquette, and comprehend cyphers.

<summary><i>Example: Using an attribute</i></summary>
> Brett is trying to run away from a raging lizardfolk. The GM tells him to roll with Might. Brett rolls a total of 6, to which he adds his Might score, which is 1, for a total of 7. It's a partial success.
> Brett manages to run away, however the GM determines that the lizardfolk turns back to call for reinforcements. Looks like stealing the urn of Udd just went from bad to worse.

A <b>savvy</b> is any domain of knowledge or savoir-faire (such as <i>Eavesdropping</i>, <i>Rock-climbing</i> or <i>Knowing when a room is silent or full of quiet things</i>) in which the character is proficient. A character is assumed to have the general knowledge of any adventurer (making simple knots, basic survival knowledge, speaking a local tongue), but savvy characters automatically succeed in doing what they're savvy in. Even if the situation would be impossible for a normal adventurer, a savvy character can still attempt it.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a savvy</i></summary>
> Rihanna and Brett are crawling through a dark underground right beneath the main temple of the lizardfolk. A heavy door with a strange stone mechanism blocks their path, and it seems as if they'll have to turn back.
> However, Rihanna is savvy in Stonework. She argues to the GM that her character would be able to find weak spots to potentially lever the door out of the way, given she uses her crowbar. The GM accepts, and Rihanna's character successfully removes the obstacle from their path, revealing a large, 7-legged creature skittering behind he door, awoken by the sound of Rihanna's work.

<b>Hit Points</b> are the amount of damage a character can endure before taking <b>Wounds</b>.

<b>Armor</b> is the quantity of damage you ignore when taking damage from attacks. You start with 0 Armor, although certain classes give Armor as part of their starting equipment.
