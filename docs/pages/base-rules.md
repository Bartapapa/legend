<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of six-sided dice (or <b>d6s</b>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky, the GM can ask them to <b>roll 2d6</b>, called a <b>challenge roll</b>. The results are added together, and compared to the following:
*  <b>6 or less</b> - <i>Failure</i>. The character doesn't manage to do what they intended, and something bad happens.
*  <b>between 7 and 9</b> - <i>Partial success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, but something bad happens.
*  <b>10 or more</b> - <i>Success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended.
*  <b>Two '6's</b> - <i>Great success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, and something good happens.

Sometimes, a <b>modifier</b> is applied to the roll - generally, it is one of the character's <b>attributes</b> depending on what the character is trying to do.

Certain situations can grant <b>boons</b> or <b>banes</b>. These are additional d6 that are rolled during a challenge roll. In the case of a boon, the player takes the best two results - in the case of a bane, they take the worst two. There can be more than one bane or boon. Banes and boons cancel each other out on a 1-by-1 basis.

That's all!

<summary><b>Create a character</b></summary>
A character starts with 0 in all of 4 main attributes. This can change with the choice of Class and Background.

A character also starts with 6 <b>Hit Points</b> (or <b>HP</b>), 10 <b>Inventory</b> slots and 10 <b>Mind</b> slots.

Choose your character's <b>Class</b>, and get its <b>Starting equipment</b> in your inventory and its <b>Starting savvies</b> in your mind.
Choose your character's <b>Background</b>, as well as one or two <b>Goals</b> - the GM will reward you for following these.

You're done!

<summary><b>Attributes, Stats and Savvies</b></summary>

A character has 4 <b>main attributes</b>:
*  <u><b>Might.</b></u> This is sheer physical strength, hardiness, resistance to pain. Generally used to break down doors, crush a skull, and holding one's breath.
*  <u><b>Grace.</b></u> This is agility, quickness and reactivity. Generally used to run across tightropes, play the piano, and ride beasts.
*  <u><b>Wit.</b></u> This is thinking quickly, perception and charm. Generally used to sense when being observed, compel a guard to look the other way or swipe the noble's purse.
*  <u><b>Lore.</b></u> This is understanding, education and breadth of knowledge. Generally used to calculate hypergeometry, know dining etiquette, and comprehend cyphers.

<summary><i>Example: Using an attribute</i></summary>
> Brett is trying to run away from a raging lizardfolk. The GM tells him to roll with Might. Brett rolls a total of 6, to which he adds his Might score, which is 1, for a total of 7. It's a partial success.
> <br>Brett manages to run away, however the GM determines that the lizardfolk turns back to call for reinforcements. Looks like stealing the urn of Udd just went from bad to worse.
</details>
<br>
A <b>savvy</b> is any domain of knowledge or savoir-faire (such as <i>Eavesdropping</i>, <i>Rock-climbing</i> or <i>Knowing when a room is silent or full of quiet things</i>) in which the character is proficient. It takes up a slot in a character's Mind. A character is assumed to have the general knowledge of any adventurer (making simple knots, basic survival knowledge, speaking a local tongue), but savvy characters automatically succeed in doing what they're savvy in. Even if the situation would be impossible for a normal adventurer, a savvy character can still attempt it.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a savvy</i></summary>
> Rihanna and Brett are crawling through a dark underground right beneath the main temple of the lizardfolk. A heavy door with a strange stone mechanism blocks their path, and it seems as if they'll have to turn back.
> <br>However, Rihanna is savvy in Stonework. She argues to the GM that her character would be able to find weak spots to potentially lever the door out of the way, given she uses her crowbar. The GM accepts, and Rihanna's character successfully removes the obstacle from their path, revealing a large, 7-legged creature skittering behind he door, awoken by the sound of Rihanna's work.
</details>
<br>
<b>Hit Points</b> are the amount of damage a character can endure before taking <b>Wounds</b>.

<b>Armor</b> is the quantity of damage you ignore when taking damage from attacks. You start with 0 Armor, although certain classes give Armor as part of their starting equipment.

<summary><b>Inventory, Mind and Goals</b></summary>
<b>Inventory</b>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with objects, or bundles of 3 objects of small objects like daggers or potions. Specific ammo, such as arrows or bolts, take up 1 slot but don't expire, unless <b>something bad happens</b>. Your inventory will also fill up with <b>Fatigue</b> and <b>Scars</b> along the way. If you have to add something to your inventory and you don't have enough space, you are <b>Exhausted</b> and can't do much of anything except crawl.

<b>Mind</b>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with savvies, beliefs, and followers. Your mind will also fill up with <b>Stress</b> and <b>Scars</b> along the way. If you have to add something to your mind and you don't have enough space, you <b>Crack</b> and can't do much of anything except whimper. Although, before that happens, you can totally just forget one of your beliefs or savvies. Just don't expect to be getting it back soon.

<b>Scars</b> can be removed with certain kinds of magic. When that isn't around, sometimes being gagged and thrown in a holding cell for a couple of days, or violently flagellating in penance does the trick.

<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>

<u>Turn order:</u> The players act before the enemies, unless the enemies surprised the players.
<u>Your turn:</u> When it's your turn, you can do one movement and one action, like attacking or casting a spell. One movement is moving to somewhere nearby - sometimes the GM will ask you to roll for difficult siuations. You can tell a bit of information to your allies during your turn.
<u>Attacking:</u> You can spend your action to attack a target you can reach with your weapon. For melee weapons, that's at arm's length. You can throw certain weapons if you can see the whites of your target's eyes. If you can see the silhouette and a few details of your target, you can use a ranged weapon. To attack, you roll - you generally use Might for melee weapons, and Grace for ranged weapons. If successful, you deal the weapon's damage to your target.

<i>On the enemies' turn, they might want to attack you back.</i>

<u>Defending:</u> When an enemy attacks you, describe how you're going to defend yourself - dodge out of the way, take the brunt of the blow with your armor, flow with your enemies' attack, etc. This will help the GM determine what attribute you add to your roll. A partial success can mean half damage.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Combat</i></summary>
> Rihanna and Brett have entered combat with a lizardman grunt and a lizardman shaman. Rihanna decides to move in through the brush and attack the shaman first using her spear by jumping on them. She rolls Might, and gets a total of 9. The GM determines that the partial success means they deal full damage, but jumping has put her in a disadvantaged situation and the shaman will take the opportunity.
> <br>Brett decides to take the grunt's focus, and uses his bow to attack from where he's hiding. Since he's advantaged, he has a boon to his attack. He rolls Grace, and gets a total of 11. A success! He deals full damage to the grunt, who turns his way and roars.
> <br>The shaman bears down on Rihanna, and tries to take a bite out of her. Rihanna states that she's rolling away, so the GM says she rolls Grace, and Rihanna rolls a total of 10. However, the shaman is advantaged, and so she adds a bane to her roll, changing the total result to a 6. Failure! She takes a total of 4 damage from the lizardman's fangs!
> <br>Now it's up to the grunt. Hopefully, Brett will be able to help his companion soon enough...
