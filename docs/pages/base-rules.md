## How to play

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of tabletop dice (<i>four, six, eight, ten, twelve and twenty-sided dice</i>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky, the GM can ask them to <b>roll</b> a <b>twenty-sided dice</b> (or <b>d20</b>), and compare it to a number. If the result on the die is equal or lower than the compared number, the character <b>Succeeds</b>. Otherwise, they <b>Fail</b>.

Certain situations can grant <b>advantage</b> or <b>disadvantage</b>. If a character has an advantage, they roll the d20 twice and take the best result. If they have a disadvantage, they roll the d20 twice and take the worst result. Advantages and disadvantages cancel each other out on a one-for-one basis, and aren't cumulative.

That's all!

## Character creation

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Create a character</b></summary>

Roll 3d6, and add the best two results. Do this three times, noting down the result for each [Attribute](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#attributes) in order. This is their <b>Score</b>. You can choose to switch two scores once.

Roll 1d6 for your <b>Hit Protection</b>. This is the amount of damage you can take before getting seriously hurt.
Roll 1d6 for your <b>Coin</b>. 

Choose a <b>[Faction](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/factions)</b>. Get your Core ability, and one Trait according to your Hit Protection, and determine your Background according to your Coin.
Choose or roll your <b>Drive</b>. This is how you're going to get stronger. It can change, if you wish.

You're done!
</details>

## Attributes

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Attributes</b></summary>

A character has 3 <b>Attributes</b>:
*  <u><b>Might.</b></u> This is sheer physical strength, hardiness, resistance to pain. Generally used to run fast, break down doors, push someone over, and hold one's breath.
*  <u><b>Grace.</b></u> This is agility, quickness and reactivity. Generally used to run across tightropes, play the piano, and ride beasts.
*  <u><b>Wit.</b></u> This is knowledge, perception and charm. Generally used to sense when being observed, compel a guard dog to look the other way or know about something.

<b>Hit Protection</b> is the amount of damage a character can take before falling unconscious.
<b>Armor</b> is the amount of damage that is reduced when you get hit by swords, claws, teeth and arrows, but not from explosions, falling, poison clouds and the like.
</details>

## Inventory

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Inventory</b></summary>

<u><b>Inventory</b></u>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with objects, or bundles of 3 objects like acorns or bottle caps. <b>Heavy</b> objects take two slots. You'll fill your Inventory up with objects, although it can also fill up with <b>Conditions</b>. If you have to add something to your Inventory and you don't have the space, you're <b>Exhausted</b> and you reduce your HP to 0 while you're exhausted. If you're exhausted and need to add Fatigue, you take 1 Might damage.
</details>

## Tools and Traits

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Tools</b></summary>
Some tools have a <b>Quality</b> to them. This is marked by a die in between parentheses. When the character uses this tool to accomplish something, then they add that tool's Quality die when <i>rolling</i>. If multiple tools are used, use the largest Quality die. Tools hat have a higher Quality are better than those of lower Quality. Some things can only be found, and never bought or even traded.
  
*  <b>d4 Quality</b> - <i>Mediocre</i>. Improvised, barely holding on.
*  <b>d6 Quality</b> - <i>Standard</i>. Common items and tools.
*  <b>d8 Quality</b> - <i>Professional</i>. Made by experienced artisans, top-notch quality material.
*  <b>d10 Quality</b> - <i>Exotic</i>. Made by legendary artisans, far beyond the ability of common animals.
*  <b>d12 Quality</b> - <i>Legendary</i>. Made by unfathomable forces, through unfathomable means. Unique.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Traits</b></summary>
Some tools have Traits, which give a bit more info on how it can be used. It can be a <i>Treasure</i> or a <i>Light</i>, for example. Here are a list of common traits and their effects.
*  <b>Treasure.</b> Many animals will accept to trade goods and services for these.
*  <b>Light.</b> This illuminates your surroundings.
*  <b>Armor.</b> Damage you take by being attacked is reduced by 1. If it's Heavy, it's reduced by 2. You can only wear 1 Armor at a time.
*  <b>Ranged.</b> You can use this tool from far away.
*  <b>Food.</b> When resting, this heals your Vigor to max.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Treasure</b></summary>
When a tool has the <b>Treasure</b> trait, it also has a Quality. You can exchange a treasure of one quality size for another object of equal or 3 objets of lower quality. By spending multiple treasures of the same quality, you can exchange it for something of one step higher quality (roll the treasure's quality die and add the results until they add up to the more valuable treasure's quality size).

## Combat

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>
Combat starts when someone first attempts to attack. At the start of combat, roll Grace. If you have at least 1 success, you go before your enemies. If you're surprised, your enemies go first - if you surprise them, you go first.

When attacking someone, roll. Generally, it's a Might roll (if close combat) or a Grace roll (if ranged combat). You deal damage equal to your degrees of success.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example attack</i></summary>
You attack with a Big Stick (d6). You roll your Might, which is a d6, as well as the quality of the used tool, which is a d6. By rolling 2d6, you roll a 4 and a 6. It's a complete success! Two successes mean 2 degrees of success, but your 6 grants an additional degree of success. With all taken into account, you deal 3 damage (3 degrees of success).
</details>

## Exploration, Encounters and Resting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Exploration</b></summary>
When exploring or going through a locale, like a house, a dungeon, or the ruins of a village inside a forest, the locale is divided into interconnected <b>Rooms</b>. Actions that are spent inside a Room take <b>10 minutes</b>, such as investigating, fighting, or gleaning info from the blood on the walls.

When exploring the great outdoors, where the scale becomes entire forests and mountains, actions take up what's called a <b>Watch</b> (or 4 hours). The great outdoors is made up of interconnected <b>Areas</b>. There are 6 Watches in a day: Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Dusk, Midnight. Moving from one Area to a connected one takes a Watch. A good sleep takes 2 Watches.

Spending time doing strenuous physical activity causes the character to suffer <b>Fatigue</b>. Fatigue takes up 1 slot in the character's Inventory.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Encounters</b></summary>
When first meeting with a creature and the GM isn't sure of the kind of first impression you're making, they might ask you to roll Wit. How the creature reacts depends on the result. The GM rolls 1d6, and the player rolls 1d6, so that the players don't know the full result.

| Reaction roll | General | Social | Monster <i>feels weaker</i> | Monster <i>feels stronger</i> |
|:--------------|:--------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| 2             | Hostile    | Rejection   | Flee        | Attack    |
| 3-5           | Aggressive | Cold        | Flee        | Attack    |
| 6-8           | Neutral    | Neutral     | Freeze      | Threaten  |
| 9-11          | Friendly   | Amicable    | Ignore      | Offer aid |
| 12            | Helpful    | High esteem | Accepts aid | Grovel    |

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Resting</b></summary>
There are two kinds of rests: <b>Sleeps</b> and <b>Naps</b>. To Sleep, you must find a shelter where there is no immediate danger. Sleeping for 8 hours removes all accumulated Fatigue. To Nap, you need an hour in a comfortable place. Napping removes 1 Fatigue. You can only Nap once per day.

While resting, you can eat <b>Food</b> in your Inventory. Doing so, you heal all your Vigor to its maximum.

</details>

## Advancement

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Path to greatness</b></summary>
Over the course of your adventures, you might <i>do something great</i>. During a session, if you manage to do at least one thing that's marked in your <b>Path to greatness</b>, you can <b>Advance.</b>

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Advance</b></summary>
When you advance, you get to do one of the following:
*  <b>Increase your Vigor</b>. You increase your Vigor by 2, increasing the die used to represent it by one step. Doing so also grants you 2 additional <b>Inventory Slots</b>.
*  <b>Increase an attribute</b>. You increase a chosen attribute by 2, increasing the die used to represent it.
*  <b>Gain a faction ability</b>. You can gain a new faction ability as defined by your chosen faction.
</details>

***

## Spellcasting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Spellcasting</b></summary>
If you have a <b>Spellbook</b>, you can cast the associated spell. Roll Wit and add a d6. The effects of the spell depend on the [sum] of the results, the [size] of the biggest die, and the [degrees] of success.

On a failure, the spell cannot be cast any more for the day, and needs to be recharged (stated in the spell). If you roll doubles, a <b>Mishap</b> occurs along with the usual effects. The GM determines what happens according to the spell and situation.

For cases where the effects of a spell would be used as a tool in ways that aren't defined by the spell's effects, then use the character's Wit as the Quality die for the spell-tool.

</details>
