## How to play

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of tabletop dice (<i>four, six, eight, ten, twelve and twenty-sided dice</i>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky or technical, the GM can ask them to <b>roll</b> a <b>twenty-sided dice</b> (or <b>d20</b>), and compare it to a number, named the <b>Difficulty</b>. If the result on the die is equal or greater than the compared number, the character <b>Succeeds</b>. Otherwise, they <b>Fail</b>. If the result is <b>a natural 20</b> (which means the d20 rolls its greatest result, 20), then it's a <b>critical success</b> and something good happens. However, <b>rolling a natural 1</b> is a <b>fumble</b> and not only does the character fail, but something bad happens as well.

Certain situations can grant <b>advantage</b> or <b>disadvantage</b>. If a character has an advantage, they roll the d20 twice and take the best result. If they have a disadvantage, they roll the d20 twice and take the worst result. Advantages and disadvantages cancel each other out on a one-for-one basis, and aren't cumulative.

Sometimes you're going to be asked to roll a <b>Save</b>. Roll a d20, and the associated bonus indicated by the kind of save, and compare to 15. If the result is 15 or more, you pass. Otherwise, you fail.

That's all!

## Character creation

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Create a character</b></summary>

Roll 3d6, and take the <b>lowest</b> result. Do this three times, noting down the result for each [Attribute](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#attributes) in order. This is their <b>Bonus</b>. You can choose to switch two bonuses at character creation. Fill in each attribute's <b>Defense</b> by adding 10 to their Bonus.

Roll 1d6 for your <b>Hit Protection</b>. This is the amount of damage you can take before getting seriously hurt.
Roll 1d6*10 for your starting <b>Coin</b>.

You start with Travel rations, Torches and a Light melee weapon of your choice.

Choose or roll a <b>[Failed career](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/failed-careers)</b>, which gives you 2 starting items as well as a starting skill.

You're done!
</details>

## Attributes and Skills

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Attributes</b></summary>

A character has 3 <b>Attributes</b>:
*  <u><b>Might.</b></u> This is sheer physical strength, hardiness, resistance to pain. Generally used to run fast, break down doors, push someone over, and hold one's breath.
*  <u><b>Grace.</b></u> This is agility, quickness and reactivity. Generally used to run across tightropes, play the piano, and ride beasts.
*  <u><b>Wit.</b></u> This is knowledge, perception and charm. Generally used to sense when being observed, compel a guard dog to look the other way or know about something.

<b>Hit Protection</b> is the amount of damage a character can take before starting to get seriously wounded. Any damage you take when you have 0 HP is deducted from your Might as <b>Ability damage</b>. If this happens, you must roll a Might save - on a success, your character can still fight. Otherwise, they receive a <b>Wound</b> (which takes up an Inventory slot), and they are <b>Incapacitated</b> until tended to be a friend and they take at least a nap. If your Might defense reaches 0, you are dead.

<b>Armor</b> is the amount of damage that is reduced when you get hit by swords, claws, teeth and arrows, but not from explosions, falling, poison clouds and the like.

<b>Grit</b> is how many conditions you can ignore (you still 'have them', but they're not in your Inventory and don't affect you. They still need to be removed as per their removal condition). You have 0 Grit at 1st level, but you gain some as you <b>[Level up](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#advancement)</b>.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Skills</b></summary>
Skills are special areas of expertise of your character. When you do something that needs special training, is particularly technical, or needs a good grasp of knowledge, you'll roll with disadvantage. If you have a skill that could work contextually, then you roll normally.

You can also get an <i>Expertise</i> with a skill, which is marked by one of your three attributes. When using your skill and you are rolling with that specific attribute, you roll with advantage.
</details>

***
## Inventory

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Inventory</b></summary>

<u><b>Inventory</b></u>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with objects, or bundles of 3 similar objects like bottles or knives. <b>Heavy</b> objects take two slots. You'll fill your Inventory up with objects, although it can also fill up with <b>Conditions</b>. If you have to add something to your Inventory and you don't have the space, you're <b>Exhausted</b> and you reduce your HP to 0 while you're exhausted. If you're exhausted and need to add Fatigue, you take 1 Might damage.

Generally speaking, your Inventory is less of an actual physical space on your character, and more about what your character can use in the game-world. Pretty much every character wears clothes - however, if you want to use your clothing to charm somebody, it should be in your Inventory. Small jewelry like rings can be worn on your character - but it <i>doesn't count</i> until it actually takes up space in your Inventory.
</details>

## Items and Traits

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Items</b></summary>
Items are things that you're going to gather when you're out there adventuring. They normally take up 1 slot of your Inventory. If you have it in your Inventory, you can use it.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Notches</b></summary>
All items have <b>Notches</b>, which are sort of like an item's Life. Notches represent consumption, wear and tear, and loss of power, depending on the item. A quiver full of arrows will mark Notches to show the depleting amount of arrows, a sword will mark Notches as it's getting chipped and bent, and a spellbook will mark Notches as the spell frees itself from its prison.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Traits</b></summary>
Some tools have Traits, which give a bit more info on how it can be used. It can be <i>Treasure</i> or <i>Bright</i>, for example. Here are a list of common traits and their effects.
  
*  <b>Treasure.</b> Many people will accept to trade goods and services for these.
*  <b>Light.</b> This can be paired with 2 other items on the same slot.
*  <b>Heavy.</b> This item takes up 2 slots. If it's held in hands, it needs 2 hands to use correctly.
*  <b>Bright.</b> This illuminates your surroundings.
*  <b>Armor.</b> Damage you take by being attacked is reduced by 1. If it's Heavy, it's reduced by 2. You can only wear 1 Armor at a time.
*  <b>Shield.</b> Damage you take by being attacked is reduced by 1, although you need a hand free to use it.
*  <b>Ranged.</b> You can use this item on things that are far away.
*  <b>Food.</b> Consume this item when resting to heal your HP to max.
*  <b>Unbreakable.</b> The item has a total of 6 Notches.
*  <b>Fragile.</b> The item has only 1 Notch.
*  <b>Magical.</b> You gain 1 Magic dice when holding this item. All spellbooks are magical.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Treasure</b></summary>
When a tool has the <b>Treasure</b> trait, it also has a (Value), which is defined by a die size going from d4 (nearly worthless) to d12 (extremely valuable). You can exchange treasures of a certain price against items of the same of inferior prices. You can also roll the treasure's Value die in order to pay for something that is 1 die size larger than it. To do so, your total result needs to be equal to or greater than the Value die of the object you want - you can roll multiple treasures in this way.

Treasures can also have specific traits, that certain NPCs and buildings will seek out.
*  <b>Civilized</b>. Cut gemstones, coin, paintings and deeds.
*  <b>Wild</b>. Unicorn horn, displacer rat tentacle, tank turtle shell and eye of newt.
*  <b>Technological</b>. Chess-playing automaton, clockwork heart, golden stopwatch and shrieking engine.
*  <b>Occult</b>. Pickled crow feet, sacrificial dagger, wizard skull, and flayed human skin.
*  <b>Aberrant</b>. Black hole pearl, fractal blade, acidic lime-green goop, and bottled whisper from beyond the stars.
*  <b>Dungeon</b>. Obsidian skull, adamantium doorknob, orb of annihilation, and drow silkmail.
*  <b>Religious</b>. Platinum prayer beads, decrepit tome of tenets, prayer rug and saint fingerbones.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Weapons</b></summary>
Weapons are separated into different categories.
  
*  <b>Light melee.</b> (Daggers, knives, clubs) These take up one hand, and deal 1d6 damage. They can be <b>dual-wielded</b>. They are always considered <i>light</i> items.
*  <b>Medium melee.</b> (Swords, axes, maces) These take up one hand, and deal 1d8 damage.
*  <b>Heavy melee.</b> (Battleaxes, halberds) These take up two hands, and deal 1d10 damage. They are always considered <i>heavy</i> items.
*  <b>Light ranged.</b> (Blowguns, slings, revolvers) These take up one hand, and deal 1d6 damage. An inventory slot is also taken up by <i>Ammunition</i>. They are always considered <i>ranged</i> items.
*  <b>Medium ranged.</b> (Bows) These take up two hands, and deal 1d8 damage. An inventory slot is also taken by <i>Ammunition</i>. They are always considered <i>ranged</i> items.
*  <b>Heavy ranged.</b> (Longbows, crossbows, rifles) These take up two hands, and deal 1d10 damage. An inventory slot is also taken up by <i>Ammunition</i>. They are always considered <i>heavy</i> and <i>ranged</i> items.

If you are <b>dual-wielding</b>, you roll 2d6 and take the best result when you attack.

Damage can be <b>Enhanced</b> or <b>Impaired</b> in certain conditions. If it is enhanced, you deal 1d12 damage. If it is impaired, you deal 1d4 damage.

## Combat

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>
Combat starts when someone first attempts to attack. At the start of combat, roll a Grace save. On a success, you go before your enemies. If you're surprised, your enemies go first - if you surprise them, you go first.

When you attack someone, you don't need to roll to hit. You immediately roll the damage die of your weapon (if you have no weapon, you do 1 damage. If your weapon is improvised, you do 1d4) and deal that much damage to your target, minus their Armor.

</details>

***
## Exploration, Encounters and Resting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Exploration</b></summary>
When exploring or going through a locale, like a house, a dungeon, or the ruins of a village inside a forest, the locale is divided into interconnected <b>Rooms</b>. Actions that are spent inside a Room take <b>10 minutes</b>, such as investigating, fighting, or gleaning info from the blood on the walls.

When exploring the great outdoors, where the scale becomes entire forests and mountains, actions take up what's called a <b>Watch</b> (or 4 hours). The great outdoors is made up of interconnected <b>Areas</b>. There are 6 Watches in a day: Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Dusk, Midnight. A long rest takes 2 Watches. Moving from one area to another connected by a road takes 1 Watch. Moving from one area to another connected by a path takes 2 Watches. Trying to find a path between two areas is [its own thing](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/additional-rules#exploration).

Spending time doing strenuous physical activity causes the character to suffer <b>Fatigue</b>. Fatigue is a condition that takes up 1 slot in the character's Inventory, and is removed on a nap.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Encounters</b></summary>
When first meeting with a creature and the GM isn't sure of the kind of first impression you're making, they might ask you to roll 2d6. How the creature reacts depends on the result. The GM rolls 1d6, and the player rolls 1d6, so that the players don't know the full result.

| Reaction roll | General | Social | Monster <i>feels weaker</i> | Monster <i>feels stronger</i> |
|:--------------|:--------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| 2             | Hostile    | Rejection   | Flee        | Attack    |
| 3-5           | Aggressive | Cold        | Flee        | Attack    |
| 6-8           | Neutral    | Neutral     | Freeze      | Threaten  |
| 9-11          | Friendly   | Amicable    | Ignore      | Offer aid |
| 12            | Helpful    | High esteem | Accepts aid | Grovel    |

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Resting</b></summary>
If you don't eat or drink for a day, you are <b>Deprived</b>. Each additional day spent without doing these gives 1 Fatigue (for each incomplete necessity), which takes up a slot in your Inventory. If you can't add more Fatigue, you take 1 Might damage per Fatigue. If you complete these necessities, you're not Deprived anymore.

There are three kinds of rests: <b>Short</b>, <b>Long</b> and <b>Full</b>. You benefit from the effects of a rest if you're not <b>Deprived</b>.

You can short rest pretty much everywhere, although you have to <b>eat</b> something. This takes 10 minutes. You heal 1d6+1 HP, and 1 Fatigue.

You can only long rest if you're in a sheltered, warm and dry place, and you <b>eat</b> some food. This takes 8 hours. You heal all lost HP, as well as all Fatigue. If your HP is at maximum, you heal 1d6+1 Ability damage if someone can tend to you.

You can only take a full rest in complete security, on a bed in town. It heals all your HP, Fatigue and ability damage. It takes <b>a week</b>, although you don't need to be only in bed during this time. A week's worth of lodging and food usually costs around 20p.

</details>

***
## Followers

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Followers</b></summary>
Followers, well, follow you around. You don't control them, however they will act in your favor. They do not demand payment, although they still must be fed and treated equally.

A default follower has 1 HD (1d6 HP), 1 in all attributes, 6 Inventory slots and a Loyalty score of 5.

Loyalty is another attribute followers have, that they have to roll a save for if ever they must not flee or if you ask them to do something riskier than what they bargained for. Loyalty can fluctuate over time, to a max of 10 and a minimum of 0. If your follower has 0 Loyalty, they leave, betray you, etc.

</details>

***
## Advancement

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Path to greatness</b></summary>
Over the course of your adventure, you'll gain <b>Adventure points</b> (or <b>AP</b>). You can get AP by recovering treasure, but also by <b>spending selflessly</b> (donating to charity, helping rebuild a home for others, etc). Each 10c spent in this way grants 1 AP.

When you reach certain amounts of adventure points, you <b>Level up</b>. The following is a table with the total amount of Adventure points you need to level up again.

| Level | Hit dice | Grit | Adventure points |
|:--------------|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| 1             | 1d6     | 0      | 0       |
| 2             | 2d6     | 1      | 1000    |
| 3             | 3d6     | 2      | 3000    |
| 4             | 4d6     | 3      | 6000    |
| 5+            | 4d6     | 4      | +5000   |

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Leveling up</b></summary>
Legends is a game about normal people becoming powerful movers of the world by luck, skill, and sheer will. At the end of a session, you gain 1 XP if you fight a dangerous foe, if you recuperate a named treasure, or discover an entirely new location. If you acted according to one of your <b>Drives</b>, you also get 1 XP. If you resolve one of your <b>Bonds</b>, again, you get 1 XP. The GM can change these in order to better reflect the world and what the players are wishing for in the story. By spending XP, you can <b>Advance</b>.

When you level up, you do the following:
*  <b>Increase your Hit Protection</b>. You gain a new Hit die, which is a d6. Roll all of your Hit die - if the sum is greater than your previous HP, this becomes your new HP. If it's less, then you increase your HP by 1. You cannot have more than 30 Max HP.
*  <b>Increase your Attributes</b>. Roll one save for each of your attributes - if you <i>Fail</i>, you increase that attribute's Bonus and Defense by 1. You can only increase a bonus and defense to 10 and 20 respectively.

<b>From level 5 onwards</b>, you only need 5000 additional adventure points before leveling up again. However, you don't gain any more Grit or Hit dice. You can choose to do <b>one</b> of the following:
*  <b>Increase your Hit Protection</b>. You gain +1 HP. You cannot have more than 25 Max HP.
*  <b>Increase an Attribute</b>. Choose <b>one</b> attribute, and roll a save. If you <i>Fail</i>, you increase that attribute's Bonus and Defense by 1. You can only increase a bonus and defense to 10 and 20 respectively.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Advancement</b></summary>
When you advance, you spend as much XP as the total number of advancements you'll have acquired after this one. For example, if you just created your character, it'll cost you 1. If you've advanced 4 times, the next one will cost you 5.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>After level 4</b></summary>
What do you do after level 4? Well, you <b>retire.</b> You won the game, congratulations. Your character becomes a helpful NPC who lives comfortably somewhere with the riches they've accumulated. Roll a new character to join the group.

...That, or you become [legendary](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/additional-rules#legend).

</details>

## Magic

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Magic dice</b></summary>
You gain Magic dice by having <b>Magical</b> items in your Inventory. When you roll magic dice, you <b>lose</b> them when their result turns up as '4' or more, preventing them from being used again until they are recuperated. You recuperate lost magic dice after a long rest.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Spellcasting</b></summary>
If you have a <b>Spellbook</b>, you can cast the associated spell. You can roll up to 4 Magic dice. The effects of the spell depend on the number of [dice] used, and the [sum] of the result.

If you roll doubles when casting a spell, you mark 1 <b>Notch</b> on it. You can only repair it by <b>Recharging</b> it.
</details>
