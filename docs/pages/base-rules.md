<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of six-sided dice (or <b>d6s</b>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky, the GM can ask them to <b>roll 2d6</b>, called a <b>challenge roll</b>. The results are added together, and compared to the following:
*  <b>6 or less</b> - <i>Failure</i>. The character doesn't manage to do what they intended, and something bad happens.
*  <b>between 7 and 9</b> - <i>Partial success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, but something bad happens.
*  <b>10 or more</b> - <i>Success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended.
*  <b>Two '6's</b> - <i>Great success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, and something good happens.

Sometimes, a <b>modifier</b> is applied to the roll - generally, it is one of the character's <b>attributes</b> depending on what the character is trying to do.

Certain situations can grant <b>boons</b> or <b>banes</b>. These are additional d6 that are rolled during a challenge roll. In the case of a boon, the player takes the best two results - in the case of a bane, they take the worst two. There can be more than one bane or boon. Banes and boons cancel each other out on a 1-by-1 basis.

That's all!
