## How to play

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of six-sided dice (or <b>d6s</b>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky, the GM can ask them to <b>roll</b>, and to count the number of successes. A <b>Success</b> happens when a die has a result of '4' or more. You generally roll one die related to the <b>Attribute</b> you're using, and an additional die if you're using a <b>Tool</b> to help you.
*  <b>0 Success</b> - <i>Failure</i>. The character doesn't manage to do what they wanted, and something bad happens.
*  <b>1 Success</b> - <i>Partial success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, but something bad happens.
*  <b>2 Successes</b> - <i>Success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended.
*  <b>Total result of '9'</b> - <i>Nine Lives</i>. Whatever the result is, the player gets a <b>Life</b> that they can use to reroll a die.

Certain situations can grant <b>boons</b> or <b>banes</b>. If a player has a boon, they roll an additional d6. If they have a bane, they remove one success from their pool after rolling.

Some rolls will count your <b>Degrees of success</b>, such as knowing how much damage you deal when you attack or how much information you get from someone you talk to. You get as many degrees of success as you have successes, and gain an additional one according to the result of each of your dice.
*  <b>6</b> - <i>+1 degree of success.</i>
*  <b>8</b> - <i>+2 degrees of success.</i>
*  <b>10</b> - <i>+3 degrees of success.</i>
*  <b>12</b> - <i>+4 degrees of success.</i>

That's all!

## Character creation

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Create a character</b></summary>

A character starts with 6 in all their [Attributes](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#attributes). You can choose to increase one to 8 by reducing another to 4.

A character also starts with 6 <b>Vigor</b> and 10 <b>Inventory Slots</b>. Use a six-sided die to represent your Vigor.

Choose a <b>[Faction](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/factions)</b>, roll for your <b>Background</b> and choose 1 <b>Faction ability</b>.

You're done!
</details>

***
## Attributes

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Attributes and Vigor</b></summary>

A character has 3 <b>Attributes</b>:
*  <u><b>Might.</b></u> This is sheer physical strength, hardiness, resistance to pain. Generally used to run fast, break down doors, push someone over, and hold one's breath.
*  <u><b>Grace.</b></u> This is agility, quickness and reactivity. Generally used to run across tightropes, play the piano, and ride beasts.
*  <u><b>Wit.</b></u> This is knowledge, perception and charm. Generally used to sense when being observed, compel a guard dog to look the other way or know about something.

<b>Vigor</b> is the amount of damage a character can take before falling unconscious.
</details>

***
## Inventory

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Inventory</b></summary>

<u><b>Inventory</b></u>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with objects, or bundles of 3 objects like acorns or bottle caps. <b>Heavy</b> objects take two slots. You'll fill your Inventory up with objects, although it can also fill up with <b>Fatigue</b>. If you have to add something to your Inventory and you don't have the space, you're <b>Exhausted</b> and can't move until you take something off. If you're exhausted and need to add Fatigue, you instead lower your Vigor by 1.
</details>

## Tools and Traits

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Tools</b></summary>
Some tools have a <b>Quality</b> to them. This is marked by a die in between parentheses. When the character uses this tool to accomplish something, then they add that tool's Quality die when <i>rolling</i>. If multiple tools are used, use the largest Quality die. Tools hat have a higher Quality are better than those of lower Quality. Some things can only be found, and never bought or even traded.
  
*  <b>d4 Quality</b> - <i>Mediocre</i>. Improvised, barely holding on.
*  <b>d6 Quality</b> - <i>Standard</i>. Common items and tools.
*  <b>d8 Quality</b> - <i>Professional</i>. Made by experienced artisans, top-notch quality material.
*  <b>d10 Quality</b> - <i>Exotic</i>. Made by legendary artisans, far beyond the ability of common animals.
*  <b>d12 Quality</b> - <i>Legendary</i>. Made by unfathomable forces, through unfathomable means. Unique.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Traits</b></summary>
Some tools have Traits, which give a bit more info on how it can be used. It can be a <i>Treasure</i> or a <i>Light</i>, for example. Here are a list of common traits and their effects.
*  <b>Treasure.</b> Many animals will accept to trade goods and services for these.
*  <b>Light.</b> This illuminates your surroundings.
*  <b>Armor.</b> Damage you take by being attacked is reduced by 1. If it's Heavy, it's reduced by 2. You can only wear 1 Armor at a time.
*  <b>Ranged.</b> You can use this tool from far away.
*  <b>Food.</b> When resting, this heals your Vigor to max.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Treasure</b></summary>
When a tool has the <b>Treasure</b> trait, it also has a Quality. You can exchange a treasure of one quality size for another object of equal or 3 objets of lower quality. By spending multiple treasures of the same quality, you can exchange it for something of one step higher quality (roll the treasure's quality die and add the results until they add up to the more valuable treasure's quality size).

## Combat

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>
Combat starts when someone first attempts to attack. At the start of combat, roll Grace. If you have at least 1 success, you go before your enemies. If you're surprised, your enemies go first - if you surprise them, you go first.

When attacking someone, roll. Generally, it's a Might roll (if close combat) or a Grace roll (if ranged combat). You deal damage equal to your degrees of success.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example attack</i></summary>
You attack with a Big Stick (d6). You roll your Might, which is a d6, as well as the quality of the used tool, which is a d6. By rolling 2d6, you roll a 4 and a 6. It's a complete success! Two successes mean 2 degrees of success, but your 6 grants an additional degree of success. With all taken into account, you deal 3 damage (3 degrees of success).
</details>

## Exploration, Encounters and Resting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Exploration</b></summary>
When exploring or going through a locale, like a house, a dungeon, or the ruins of a village inside a forest, the locale is divided into interconnected <b>Rooms</b>. Actions that are spent inside a Room take <b>10 minutes</b>, such as investigating, fighting, or gleaning info from the blood on the walls.

When exploring the great outdoors, where the scale becomes entire forests and mountains, actions take up what's called a <b>Watch</b> (or 4 hours). The great outdoors is made up of interconnected <b>Areas</b>. There are 6 Watches in a day: Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Dusk, Midnight. Moving from one Area to a connected one takes a Watch. A good sleep takes 2 Watches.

Spending time doing strenuous physical activity causes the character to suffer <b>Fatigue</b>. Fatigue takes up 1 slot in the character's Inventory.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Encounters</b></summary>
When first meeting with a creature and the GM isn't sure of the kind of first impression you're making, they might ask you to roll Wit. How the creature reacts depends on the result. The GM rolls 1d6, and the player rolls 1d6, so that the players don't know the full result.

| Reaction roll | General | Social | Monster <i>feels weaker</i> | Monster <i>feels stronger</i> |
|:--------------|:--------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| 2             | Hostile    | Rejection   | Flee        | Attack    |
| 3-5           | Aggressive | Cold        | Flee        | Attack    |
| 6-8           | Neutral    | Neutral     | Freeze      | Threaten  |
| 9-11          | Friendly   | Amicable    | Ignore      | Offer aid |
| 12            | Helpful    | High esteem | Accepts aid | Grovel    |

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Resting</b></summary>
There are two kinds of rests: <b>Sleeps</b> and <b>Naps</b>. To Sleep, you must find a shelter where there is no immediate danger. Sleeping for 8 hours removes all accumulated Fatigue. To Nap, you need an hour in a comfortable place. Napping removes 1 Fatigue. You can only Nap once per day.

While resting, you can eat <b>Food</b> in your Inventory. Doing so, you heal all your Vigor to its maximum.

</details>

## Advancement

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Path to greatness</b></summary>
Over the course of your adventures, you might <i>do something great</i>. During a session, if you manage to do at least one thing that's marked in your <b>Path to greatness</b>, you can <b>Advance.</b>

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Advance</b></summary>
When you advance, you get to do one of the following:
*  <b>Increase your Vigor</b>. You increase your Vigor by 2, increasing the die used to represent it by one step. Doing so also grants you 2 additional <b>Inventory Slots</b>.
*  <b>Increase an attribute</b>. You increase a chosen attribute by 2, increasing the die used to represent it.
*  <b>Gain a faction ability</b>. You can gain a new faction ability as defined by your chosen faction.
</details>

## Spellcasting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Spellcasting</b></summary>
If you have a <b>Spellbook</b>, you can cast the associated spell. Roll Wit and add a d6. The effects of the spell depend on the [sum] of the results, the [size] of the biggest die, and the [degrees] of success.

On a failure, the spell cannot be cast any more for the day, and needs to be recharged (stated in the spell). If you roll doubles, a <b>Mishap</b> occurs along with the usual effects. The GM determines what happens according to the spell and situation.

For cases where the effects of a spell would be used as a tool in ways that aren't defined by the spell's effects, then use the character's Wit as the Quality die for the spell-tool.
