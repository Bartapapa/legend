## How to play

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of six-sided dice (or <b>d6s</b>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky, the GM can ask them to <b>roll</b>, and to count the number of successes. A <b>Success</b> happens when a die has a result of '4' or more. You generally roll one die related to the <b>Attribute</b> you're using, and an additional die if you're using a <b>Tool</b> to help you.
*  <b>0 Success</b> - <i>Failure</i>. The character doesn't manage to do what they wanted, and something bad happens.
*  <b>1 Success</b> - <i>Partial success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, but something bad happens.
*  <b>2 Successes</b> - <i>Success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended.
*  <b>Total result of '9'</b> - <i>Nine Lives</i>. Whatever the result is, the player gets a <b>Life</b> that they can use to reroll a die.

Certain situations can grant <b>boons</b> or <b>banes</b>. If a player has a boon, they roll an additional d6. If they have a bane, they remove one success from their pool after rolling.

That's all!

## Character creation

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Create a character</b></summary>
A character starts with 6 in all their <b>[Attributes](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#attributes)</b>. You can choose to increase one to 8 by reducing another to 4.

A character also starts with 6 <b>Vigor</b> and 10 <b>Inventory Slots</b>. Use a six-sided die to represent your Vigor.

Choose a <b>[Faction](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/factions)</b>. 

Choose or roll 2 <b>[Gifts](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/gifts)</b>, which each take up a slot in your Mind.
Choose or roll your character's <b>[Failed career](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/failed-careers)</b>. It takes up a slot in your Mind. It gives you a few starting items, as well as a bonus to one of your attributes.
Choose, or create, as many Goals as you'd like - you'll be rewarded for completing them.

Each character starts with 3 rations (1 slot), 3 torches (1 slot), and 1 light weapon.
Roll once for your [bonus gear](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#starting-gear).

You're done!

## Attributes

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Attributes and Vigor</b></summary>

A character has 3 <b>Attributes</b>:
*  <u><b>Might.</b></u> This is sheer physical strength, hardiness, resistance to pain. Generally used to run fast, break down doors, push someone over, and hold one's breath.
*  <u><b>Grace.</b></u> This is agility, quickness and reactivity. Generally used to run across tightropes, play the piano, and ride beasts.
*  <u><b>Wit.</b></u> This is knowledge, perception and charm. Generally used to sense when being observed, compel a guard dog to look the other way or know about something.

<b>Vigor</b> is the amount of damage a character can take before falling unconscious.
</details>

***
## Inventory

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Inventory</b></summary>

<u><b>Inventory</b></u>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with objects, or bundles of 3 objects like acorns or bottle caps. <b>Heavy</b> objects take two slots. You'll fill it up with objects, although it can also fill up with <b>Fatigue</b>. If you have to add something to your Inventory and you don't have the space, you're <b>Exhausted</b> and can't move until you take something off.
</details>

***
## Tools and Traits

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Tools</b></summary>
Some tools have a <b>Quality</b> to them. This is marked by a die in between parentheses. When the character uses this tool to accomplish something, then they add that tool's Quality die when <i>rolling</i>. If multiple tools are used, use the largest Quality die.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Traits</b></summary>
Some tools have Traits, which give a bit more info on how it can be used. It can be a <i>Treasure</i> or a <i>Light</i>, for example. Here are a list of common traits and their effects.
*  <b>Treasure.</b> Many animals will accept to trade goods and services for these.
*  <b>Light.</b> This illuminates your surroundings.
*  <b>Armor.</b> Damage you take by being attacked is reduced by 1. If it's Heavy, it's reduced by 2. You can only wear 1 Armor at a time.
*  <b>Ranged.</b> You can use this tool from far away.
</details>

## Combat

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>
Combat starts when someone first attempts to attack. At the start of combat, roll Grace. If you have at least 1 success, you go before your enemies. If you're surprised, your enemies go first - if you surprise them, you go first.

When attacking someone, roll. Generally, it's a Might roll (if close combat) or a Grace roll (if ranged combat). If you succeed, you deal 1 damage per success. You deal additional damage based on your <i>degree of success</i>, that is to say by how many steps of two your highest success goes over 4.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example attack</i></summary>
You attack with a Big Stick (d6). You roll your Might, which is a d6, as well as the quality of the used tool, which is a d6. By rolling 2d6, you roll a 4 and a 6. It's a complete success! Two successes mean 2 damage, but your 6 is 2 points higher than 4, so it increases your degree of success. With all taken into account, you deal 3 damage (2 successes + 1 degree of success).
</details>

</details>

***
## Wounds

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Dying, Wounds, Scars and Healing</b></summary>
<u><b>Dying:</b></u> When you have 0 Hit Points, all damage you sustain is converted to <b>Wounds</b>. If you have 0 HP and you get Wounded, roll Might with a penalty equal to your number of Wounds. On a Failure, you're <b>Dying</b>. At the end of each of your turns when you're Dying, you gain 1 Wound.

If you reach 10 Wounds, you die - make a new character. 

While Dying, you can spend your entire turn (action and movement) to try and stabilize. Roll Might, and on a success you stabilize and you're not Dying anymore. An ally can spend their action to attempt to stabilize you, but they need some medical tools for that. Whatever happens, if you regain HP, like from healing magic or potions, you stabilize.

Stabilizing does not heal your Wounds. You can however heal all your wounds by taking a <b>Scar</b>. You decide whether your Scar takes place in your Inventory or Mind. You can't remove Scars except with exceptional magic or other very complicated tasks. However, when you do get a scar, you also note down the situation in which you acquired it. You can use your new Scar as if it were a Savvy.

<u><b>Healing:</b></u> An 8-hour rest in good conditions (something to eat, warm, and sheltered) removes all Wounds and heals HP to full. An hour-long break where you eat a sandwich or something heals all HP, although only once per day; this is called <b>Lunch</b>.

## Exploration and Encounters

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Exploration</b></summary>
When exploring or going through a locale, like a house, a dungeon, or the ruins of a village inside a forest, the locale is divided into interconnected <b>Rooms</b>. Actions that are spent inside a Room take <b>10 minutes</b>, such as investigating, fighting, or gleaning info from the blood on the walls.

When exploring the great outdoors, where the scale becomes entire forests and mountains, actions take up what's called a <b>Watch</b> (or 4 hours). The great outdoors is made up of interconnected <b>Areas</b>. There are 6 Watches in a day: Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Dusk, Midnight. Moving from one Area to a connected one takes a Watch. A good sleep takes 2 Watches.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Encounters</b></summary>
When first meeting with a creature and the GM isn't sure of the kind of first impression you're making, they might ask for a Reaction roll. What the creature then does then depends on the result. The character who is perceived as the most important by the creature (generally, the most prominent character) adds +Wit to the roll. The GM rolls 1d6, and the player rolls 1d6, so that the players don't know the full result.

| Reaction roll | (2d6) | General | Social | Monster             |                   |
|:--------------|:------|:--------|:-------| <i>feels weaker</i> | <i>feels stronger |
| 2             |       | Hostile    | Rejection   | Flee        | Attack    |
| 3-5           |       | Aggressive | Cold        | Flee        | Attack    |
| 6-8           |       | Neutral    | Neutral     | Freeze      | Threaten  |
| 9-11          |       | Friendly   | Amicable    | Ignore      | Offer aid |
| 12            |       | Helpful    | High esteem | Accepts aid | Grovel    |

</details>

***
## Treasures

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Treasures</b></summary>
Anything you pick up can have a value. Instead of taking into account the precise value of objects, they are divided into 4 categories of worth:
*  <b>Trash</b>. This has absolutely no value, like a bent fork.
*  <b>Mundane</b>. A bag of silver coins, a wood-carved brooch, or a pair of simple earrings.
*  <b>Valuable</b>. A bag of gold coins, a painting by a well-known artist, or a horse.
*  <b>Treasure</b>. A bag of platinum coins, a spellbook, or a crown of a forgotten lord.

You generally can trade an object for an object of similar value. Some objects can't be traded for, they must be earned or found. Shopkeeps, questgivers, wandering traders, kings, warlords and such can all accept treasures for certain services. In general, 4 Mundane objects are a Valuable, and 4 Valuable objects are a Treasure.

Most valuable objects have <b>Traits</b> that further define them. An apothecary might be trying to find a kind of valuable, while an exorcist willing to part with a spellbook might want another kind.
*  <b>Civilized</b>. Cut gemstones, coin, paintings and deeds.
*  <b>Wild</b>. Unicorn horn, displacer rat tentacle, tank turtle shell and eye of newt.
*  <b>Technological</b>. Chess-playing automaton, clockwork heart, golden stopwatch and shrieking engine.
*  <b>Occult</b>. Pickled crow feet, sacrificial dagger, wizard skull, and flayed human skin.
*  <b>Aberrant</b>. Black hole pearl, fractal blade, acidic lime-green goop, and bottled whisper from beyond the stars.
*  <b>Dungeon</b>. Obsidian skull, adamantium doorknob, orb of annihilation, and drow silkmail.
*  <b>Religious</b>. Platinum prayer beads, decrepit tome of tenets, prayer rug and saint fingerbones.

## Advancement

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Advancement and Carousing</b></summary>
When you are back in the city, it is time to reap the rewards of your adventure. By spending your valuables and treasures while carousing, you can potentially level up. When you spend the equivalent of a Treasure, you level up.
<br>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Celebrate</b></summary>
Get drunk and get known! For each Valuable spent this way, spend a day hungover and get a new <b>Friend</b>. Your friend stays in this town, and can do favors for you. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, one of your Friends becomes a <b>Follower</b> who'll follow you on your adventures. They act as a classless level 0 character (same as level 1, but no class) until they level up. Followers take a Mind slot.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Build a home</b></summary>
For each Valuable spent this way, you get 1 piece of mundane furniture. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you are now the proud owner of a small house. For each additional Treasure you spend, even on subsequent carousing actions, you can increase the size of your house. The people who might work in your home will probably never set out on an adventure with you, however they are loyal to you and will automatically do what is expected of them, and can do favors for you if they're asked nicely (or paid more).
*  <b>Small</b>. A cottage. It is always filled with the necessities to live, such as food and bedding, as well as basic rooms such as a kitchen, a living room and 2 bedrooms.
*  <b>Medium</b>. A two-story home. It has a large field in which cattle can live if you bring them back here.
*  <b>Large</b>. A villa. It has a large garden in which plants can thrive if you bring them back to plant here. You also have 1 housekeeper and 1 guard.
*  <b>Mansion</b>. It has a large, full library with plenty of books on common principles of various domains of knowledge. You have an additional housekeeper and guard.
*  <b>Castle</b>. For each additional treasure, you can add a very specific room, such as a smithing room, alchemy room or even a bakery. You have 5 housekeepers and 5 guards.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Train a savvy</b></summary>
For each Valuable spent this way, you can add an <b>Expertise</b> to one of your Savvies, which allows you to succeed in near-impossible odds in a very specific context of application of your savvy. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you gain an entirely new Savvy.
</details>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Leveling up</b></summary>
When you level up, you get to do each of the following:
*  <b>Increase your HP</b>. Reroll your max HP, and add +2. You have a max of 10 base HP (modifiers can still apply).
*  <b>Find new goals</b>. Remove, replace or gain new Goals that you place in your Mind.
*  <b>Heal a scar</b>. Remove one of your characters' Scars if you wish. It'll never truly disappear.

## Spellcasting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Spellcasting</b></summary>
Some people can cast spells. They have <b>Magic Dice</b> (or <b>MD</b>) that they use to do so. For every <b>Magical</b>b> object the character has in their Inventory or Mind, they gain 1 Magic Dice, which is a d6.
  
<u><b>Casting a spell:</b></u> Whenever you cast a spell, you decide how many MD to invest in it, up to your maximum number of MD or 4, whichever is lower. The effects of the spell depend on the number of [dice] invested, as well as the [sum] of all results.

If an MD rolls a 6, you lose it, and can't use it anymire. Generally, classes recuperate lost MD after a good rest, although some of them don't.

Every time you roll doubles (the same result on 2 different dice), there's a <b>[Mishap](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/spells)</b>.
