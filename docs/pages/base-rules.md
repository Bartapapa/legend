## How to play

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of six-sided dice (or <b>d6s</b>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky, the GM can ask them to <b>roll 2d6</b>, called a <b>challenge roll</b>. The results are added together, and compared to the following:
*  <b>6 or less</b> - <i>Failure</i>. The character doesn't manage to do what they intended, and something bad happens.
*  <b>between 7 and 9</b> - <i>Partial success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, but something bad happens.
*  <b>10 or more</b> - <i>Success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended.
*  <b>Two '6's</b> - <i>Great success</i>. The character manages to do what they intended, and something good happens.

Sometimes, a <b>modifier</b> is applied to the roll - generally, it is one of the character's <b>attributes</b> depending on what the character is trying to do.

Certain situations can grant <b>boons</b> or <b>banes</b>. These are additional d6 that are rolled during a challenge roll. In the case of a boon, the player takes the best two results - in the case of a bane, they take the worst two. There can be more than one bane or boon. Banes and boons cancel each other out on a 1-by-1 basis.

That's all!

## Character creation

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Create a character</b></summary>
A character starts with 0 in all attributes. For each attribute, in order, roll for attribute changes using the table below:
  
| Attribute change | (2d6) |       |       |
|:-----------------|:------|:------|:------|
| 2-4              | 5-8   | 9-10  | 11-12 |
| -1               | +0    | +1    | +2    |

A character also starts with 6 <b>Hit Points</b> (or <b>HP</b>), 10 <b>Inventory</b> slots and 10 <b>Mind</b> slots.

Choose or roll 2 <b>[Gifts](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/gifts)</b>, which each take up a slot in your Mind.
Choose or roll your character's <b>[Failed career](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/failed-careers)</b>. It takes up a slot in your Mind. It gives you a few starting items, as well as a bonus to one of your attributes.
Choose, or create, as many Goals as you'd like - you'll be rewarded for completing them.

Each character starts with 3 rations (1 slot), 3 torches (1 slot), and 1 light weapon.
Roll once for your [bonus gear](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#starting-gear).

You're done!

## Attributes

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Attributes, Stats and Savvies</b></summary>

A character has 4 <b>main attributes</b>:
*  <u><b>Might.</b></u> This is sheer physical strength, hardiness, resistance to pain. Generally used to run fast, break down doors, crush a skull, and holding one's breath. Can be added to the damage roll of certain weapons, and adds Inventory slots.
*  <u><b>Grace.</b></u> This is agility, quickness and reactivity. Generally used to run across tightropes, play the piano, and ride beasts. Generally added to attack rolls.
*  <u><b>Wit.</b></u> This is thinking quickly, perception and charm. Generally used to sense when being observed, compel a guard to look the other way or swipe the noble's purse. Generally added to reaction rolls.
*  <u><b>Lore.</b></u> This is understanding, education and breadth of knowledge. Generally used to calculate hypergeometry, know dining etiquette, and comprehend cyphers. Adds Mind slots.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using an attribute</i></summary>
> Brett is trying to run away from a raging lizardfolk. The GM tells him to roll with Might. Brett rolls a total of 6, to which he adds his Might score, which is 1, for a total of 7. It's a partial success.
> <br>Brett manages to run away, however the GM determines that the lizardfolk turns back to call for reinforcements. Looks like stealing the urn of Udd just went from bad to worse.
</details>
<br>
A <b>savvy</b> is any domain of knowledge or savoir-faire (such as <i>Eavesdropping</i>, <i>Rock-climbing</i> or <i>Knowing when a room is silent or full of quiet things</i>) in which the character is proficient. It takes up a slot in a character's Mind. A character is assumed to have the general knowledge of any adventurer (making simple knots, basic survival knowledge, speaking a local tongue), but savvy characters automatically succeed in doing what they're savvy in. Even if the situation would be impossible for a normal adventurer, a savvy character can still attempt it.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a savvy</i></summary>
> Rihanna and Brett are crawling through a dark underground right beneath the main temple of the lizardfolk. A heavy door with a strange stone mechanism blocks their path, and it seems as if they'll have to turn back.
> <br>However, Rihanna is savvy in Stonework. She argues to the GM that her character would be able to find weak spots to potentially lever the door out of the way, given she uses her crowbar. The GM accepts, and Rihanna's character successfully removes the obstacle from their path, revealing a large, 7-legged creature skittering behind he door, awoken by the sound of Rihanna's work.
</details>
<br>
<b>Hit Points</b> are the amount of damage a character can endure before taking <b>Wounds</b>.

<b>Armor</b> is the quantity of damage you ignore when taking damage from attacks. You start with 0 Armor, although certain classes give Armor as part of their starting equipment.
</details>

***
## Inventory and Mind

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Inventory, Mind</b></summary>

<u><b>Inventory</b></u>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with objects, or bundles of 3 objects of small objects like daggers or potions. Specific ammo, such as arrows or bolts, take up 1 slot but don't expire, unless <b>something bad happens</b>. Your inventory will also fill up with <b>Scars</b> along the way. If you have to add something to your inventory and you don't have enough space, you are <b>reduced to 0 HP.</b>

<u><b>Mind</b></u>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with savvies, beliefs, and followers. Your mind will also fill up with <b>Scars</b> along the way. If you have to add something to your mind and you don't have enough space, you <b>Crack</b> and can't do much of anything except whimper. 

<u><b>Scars</b></u> can be removed with certain kinds of magic. When that isn't around, sometimes being gagged and thrown in a holding cell for a couple of days, or violently flagellating in penance does the trick.
</details>

***
## Equipment

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Melee weapons</b></summary>

<u><b>Improvised</b></u> weapons (rocks, chairs, bottles) deal 1d3 damage. Most of them <b>break</b> on max damage.

<u><b>Light</b></u> weapons (daggers, javelins) deal 1d6 damage. You can use one in your off-hand, and can be thrown.

<u><b>Medium</b></u> weapons (swords, axes) deal 1d6+Might damage. If wielded in two hands, roll twice and take the best.

<u><b>Heavy</b></u> weapons (greatswords, massive clubs) deal 2d6+Might damage. Need two hands to be wielded.

<u><b>Polearms</b></u> deal 1d6+Might damage. They need two hands to be wielded. One boon on attacks against anyone whose weapon doesn't reach as far as yours. Can be difficult to use in narrow spaces (1 bane).

<u><b>Two-weapon fighting</b></u>. When you attack and miss, you can roll again.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Ranged weapons</b></summary>
  
<u><b>Light</b></u> weapons (darts) deal 1 damage. Can attack twice.
  
<u><b>Medium</b></u> weapons (slings) deal 1d3 damage.

<u><b>Heavy</b></u> weapons (bows) deal 1d6 damage. They need two hands.

<u><b>Mechanical</b></u> weapons (crossbows, muskets) deal 2d6 damage. They need to be reloaded by spending your action.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Armor</b></summary>
Each piece of armor you have in your inventory increases your <b>Armor</b> by 1, reducing damage taken by attacks. You can wear a maximum of 5 pieces of armor. <br>
You can't swim, sneak or jump when wearing 3 or more pieces of armor.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Shields</b></summary>
Anyone using a shield can use their reaction to block attacks, reducing their damage by 1d6. Before rolling, you can state that you sunder your shield, nullifying all damage but destroying it in the process)
</details>

***
## Combat

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>

<u><b>Turn order:</b></u> The players act before the enemies, unless the enemies surprised the players.

<u><b>Your turn:</b></u> When it's your turn, you can do one movement and one action, like attacking or casting a spell. One movement is moving to somewhere nearby - sometimes the GM will ask you to roll for difficult siuations. You can tell a bit of information to your allies during your turn.

<u><b>Attacking:</b></u> You can spend your action to attack a target you can reach with your weapon. For melee weapons, that's at arm's length. You can throw certain weapons if you can see the whites of your target's eyes. If you can see the silhouette and a few details of your target, you can use a ranged weapon. To attack, you roll - you generally use Might for melee weapons, and Grace for ranged weapons. If successful, you deal the weapon's damage to your target.

<i>On the enemies' turn, they might want to attack you back.</i>

<u><b>Defending:</b></u> When an enemy attacks you, describe how you're going to defend yourself - dodge out of the way, take the brunt of the blow with your armor, flow with your enemies' attack, etc. This will help the GM determine what attribute you add to your roll. A partial success can mean half damage.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Combat</i></summary>
> Rihanna and Brett have entered combat with a lizardman grunt and a lizardman shaman. Rihanna decides to move in through the brush and attack the shaman first using her spear by jumping on them. She rolls Might, and gets a total of 9. The GM determines that the partial success means they deal full damage, but jumping has put her in a disadvantaged situation and the shaman will take the opportunity.
> <br>Brett decides to take the grunt's focus, and uses his bow to attack from where he's hiding. Since he's advantaged, he has a boon to his attack. He rolls Grace, and gets a total of 11. A success! He deals full damage to the grunt, who turns his way and roars.
> <br>The shaman bears down on Rihanna, and tries to take a bite out of her. Rihanna states that she's rolling away, so the GM says she rolls Grace, and Rihanna rolls a total of 10. However, the shaman is advantaged, and so she adds a bane to her roll, changing the total result to a 6. Failure! She takes a total of 4 damage from the lizardman's fangs!
> <br>Now it's up to the grunt. Hopefully, Brett will be able to help his companion soon enough...
</details>
<br>

</details>

***
## Wounds

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Dying, Wounds, Scars and Healing</b></summary>
<u><b>Dying:</b></u> When you have 0 Hit Points, all damage you sustain is converted to <b>Wounds</b>. If you have 0 HP and you get Wounded, roll Might with a penalty equal to your number of Wounds. On a Failure, you're <b>Dying</b>. At the end of each of your turns when you're Dying, you gain 1 Wound.

If you reach 10 Wounds, you die - make a new character. 

While Dying, you can spend your entire turn (action and movement) to try and stabilize. Roll Might, and on a success you stabilize and you're not Dying anymore. An ally can spend their action to attempt to stabilize you, but they need some medical tools for that. Whatever happens, if you regain HP, like from healing magic or potions, you stabilize.

Stabilizing does not heal your Wounds. You can however heal all your wounds by taking a <b>Scar</b>. You decide whether your Scar takes place in your Inventory or Mind. You can't remove Scars except with exceptional magic or other very complicated tasks. However, when you do get a scar, you also note down the situation in which you acquired it. You can use your new Scar as if it were a Savvy.

<u><b>Healing:</b></u> An 8-hour rest in good conditions (something to eat, warm, and sheltered) removes all Wounds and heals HP to full. An hour-long break where you eat a sandwich or something heals all HP, although only once per day; this is called <b>Lunch</b>.

## Exploration and Encounters

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Exploration</b></summary>
When exploring or going through a locale, like a house, a dungeon, or the ruins of a village inside a forest, the locale is divided into interconnected <b>Rooms</b>. Actions that are spent inside a Room take <b>10 minutes</b>, such as investigating, fighting, or gleaning info from the blood on the walls.

When exploring the great outdoors, where the scale becomes entire forests and mountains, actions take up what's called a <b>Watch</b> (or 4 hours). The great outdoors is made up of interconnected <b>Areas</b>. There are 6 Watches in a day: Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Dusk, Midnight. Moving from one Area to a connected one takes a Watch. A good sleep takes 2 Watches.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Encounters</b></summary>
When first meeting with a creature and the GM isn't sure of the kind of first impression you're making, they might ask for a Reaction roll. What the creature then does then depends on the result. The character who is perceived as the most important by the creature (generally, the most prominent character) adds +Wit to the roll. The GM rolls 1d6, and the player rolls 1d6, so that the players don't know the full result.

| Reaction roll | (2d6) | General | Social | Monster             |                   |
|:--------------|:------|:--------|:-------| <i>feels weaker</i> | <i>feels stronger |
| 2             |       | Hostile    | Rejection   | Flee        | Attack    |
| 3-5           |       | Aggressive | Cold        | Flee        | Attack    |
| 6-8           |       | Neutral    | Neutral     | Freeze      | Threaten  |
| 9-11          |       | Friendly   | Amicable    | Ignore      | Offer aid |
| 12            |       | Helpful    | High esteem | Accepts aid | Grovel    |

</details>

## Treasures

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Treasures</b></summary>
Anything you pick up can have a value. Instead of taking into account the precise value of objects, they are divided into 4 categories of worth:
*  <b>Trash</b>. This has absolutely no value, like a bent fork.
*  <b>Mundane</b>. A bag of silver coins, a wood-carved brooch, or a pair of simple earrings.
*  <b>Valuable</b>. A bag of gold coins, a painting by a well-known artist, or a horse.
*  <b>Treasure</b>. A bag of platinum coins, a spellbook, or a crown of a forgotten lord.

You generally can trade an object for an object of similar value. Some objects can't be traded for, they must be earned or found. Shopkeeps, questgivers, wandering traders, kings, warlords and such can all accept treasures for certain services. In general, 4 Mundane objects are a Valuable, and 4 Valuable objects are a Treasure.

Most valuable objects have <b>Traits</b> that further define them. An apothecary might be trying to find a kind of valuable, while an exorcist willing to part with a spellbook might want another kind.
*  <b>Civilized</b>. Cut gemstones, coin, paintings and deeds.
*  <b>Wild</b>. Unicorn horn, displacer rat tentacle, tank turtle shell and eye of newt.
*  <b>Technological</b>. Chess-playing automaton, clockwork heart, golden stopwatch and shrieking engine.
*  <b>Occult</b>. Pickled crow feet, sacrificial dagger, wizard skull, and flayed human skin.
*  <b>Aberrant</b>. Black hole pearl, fractal blade, acidic lime-green goop, and bottled whisper from beyond the stars.
*  <b>Dungeon</b>. Obsidian skull, adamantium doorknob, orb of annihilation, and drow silkmail.
*  <b>Religious</b>. Platinum prayer beads, decrepit tome of tenets, prayer rug and saint fingerbones.

## Advancement

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Advancement and Carousing</b></summary>
When you are back in the city, it is time to reap the rewards of your adventure. By spending your valuables and treasures while carousing, you can potentially level up. When you spend the equivalent of a Treasure, you level up.
<br>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Celebrate</b></summary>
Get drunk and get known! For each Valuable spent this way, spend a day hungover and get a new <b>Friend</b>. Your friend stays in this town, and can do favors for you. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, one of your Friends becomes a <b>Follower</b> who'll follow you on your adventures. They act as a classless level 0 character (same as level 1, but no class) until they level up. Followers take a Mind slot.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Build a home</b></summary>
For each Valuable spent this way, you get 1 piece of mundane furniture. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you are now the proud owner of a small house. For each additional Treasure you spend, even on subsequent carousing actions, you can increase the size of your house. The people who might work in your home will probably never set out on an adventure with you, however they are loyal to you and will automatically do what is expected of them, and can do favors for you if they're asked nicely (or paid more).
*  <b>Small</b>. A cottage. It is always filled with the necessities to live, such as food and bedding, as well as basic rooms such as a kitchen, a living room and 2 bedrooms.
*  <b>Medium</b>. A two-story home. It has a large field in which cattle can live if you bring them back here.
*  <b>Large</b>. A villa. It has a large garden in which plants can thrive if you bring them back to plant here. You also have 1 housekeeper and 1 guard.
*  <b>Mansion</b>. It has a large, full library with plenty of books on common principles of various domains of knowledge. You have an additional housekeeper and guard.
*  <b>Castle</b>. For each additional treasure, you can add a very specific room, such as a smithing room, alchemy room or even a bakery. You have 5 housekeepers and 5 guards.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Train a savvy</b></summary>
For each Valuable spent this way, you can add an <b>Expertise</b> to one of your Savvies, which allows you to succeed in near-impossible odds in a very specific context of application of your savvy. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you gain an entirely new Savvy.
</details>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Leveling up</b></summary>
When you level up, you get to do each of the following:
*  <b>Increase your HP</b>. Reroll your max HP, and add +2. You have a max of 10 base HP (modifiers can still apply).
*  <b>Find new goals</b>. Remove, replace or gain new Goals that you place in your Mind.
*  <b>Heal a scar</b>. Remove one of your characters' Scars if you wish. It'll never truly disappear.

## Spellcasting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Spellcasting</b></summary>
Some people can cast spells. They have <b>Magic Dice</b> (or <b>MD</b>) that they use to do so. For every <b>Magical</b>b> object the character has in their Inventory or Mind, they gain 1 Magic Dice, which is a d6.
  
<u><b>Casting a spell:</b></u> Whenever you cast a spell, you decide how many MD to invest in it, up to your maximum number of MD or 4, whichever is lower. The effects of the spell depend on the number of [dice] invested, as well as the [sum] of all results.

If an MD rolls a 6, you lose it, and can't use it anymire. Generally, classes recuperate lost MD after a good rest, although some of them don't.

Every time you roll doubles (the same result on 2 different dice), there's a <b>[Mishap](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/spells)</b>.
