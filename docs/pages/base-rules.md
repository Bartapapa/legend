## How to play

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>How to play</b></summary>
The game's a bit like a conversation between two groups of people - there are <b>players</b>, who incarnate characters in the world, and say what they do, and there is one <b>Game Master</b>, or <b>GM</b>, who describes the situation, gives context and interprets the rules. All you need is pencils, erasers, a handful of tabletop dice (<i>four, six, eight, ten, twelve and twenty-sided dice</i>), and some time on your hands.

When a player decides their character does something risky, the GM can ask them to <b>roll</b> a <b>twenty-sided dice</b> (or <b>d20</b>), and compare it to a number. If the result on the die is equal or lower than the compared number, the character <b>Succeeds</b>. Otherwise, they <b>Fail</b>. If the result is <b>exactly the target number</b>, then it's a critical success and something good happens.

Certain situations can grant <b>advantage</b> or <b>disadvantage</b>. If a character has an advantage, they roll the d20 twice and take the best result. If they have a disadvantage, they roll the d20 twice and take the worst result. Advantages and disadvantages cancel each other out on a one-for-one basis, and aren't cumulative.

Some situations call for an <b>opposed roll</b>, that is to say two characters are competing against one another. One's trying to sneak past, while the other is keeping an eye out, for example. In that case, they <b>both roll</b>, and the <b>successful roll with the highest score</b> wins.

That's all!

## Character creation

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Create a character</b></summary>

Roll 3d6, and add the best two results. Do this three times, noting down the result for each [Attribute](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#attributes) in order. This is their <b>Score</b>. You can choose to switch two scores once.

Roll 1d6 for your <b>Hit Protection</b>. This is the amount of damage you can take before getting seriously hurt.
Roll 1d6 for your <b>Coin</b>. 

Choose a <b>[Faction](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/factions)</b>. Get your Core ability and one Gift according to your Hit Protection, and determine your Background according to your Coin. You get the skill of your Background.

Choose or roll your <b>[Drive](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/drives)</b>. This is one of the ways for you to get stronger. It can change, if you wish.

You're done!

## Attributes and Skills

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Attributes</b></summary>

A character has 3 <b>Attributes</b>:
*  <u><b>Might.</b></u> This is sheer physical strength, hardiness, resistance to pain. Generally used to run fast, break down doors, push someone over, and hold one's breath.
*  <u><b>Grace.</b></u> This is agility, quickness and reactivity. Generally used to run across tightropes, play the piano, and ride beasts.
*  <u><b>Wit.</b></u> This is knowledge, perception and charm. Generally used to sense when being observed, compel a guard dog to look the other way or know about something.

<b>Hit Protection</b> is the amount of damage a character can take before starting to get seriously wounded. Any damage you take when you have 0 HP is deducted from your Might as <b>Ability damage</b>. If this happens, you must roll Might - on a success, your character can still fight. Otherwise, they receive a <b>Wound</b> (which takes up an Inventory slot), and they are <b>Incapacitated</b> until tended to be a friend and they take at least a nap.

<b>Armor</b> is the amount of damage that is reduced when you get hit by swords, claws, teeth and arrows, but not from explosions, falling, poison clouds and the like.

<b>Grit</b> is how many conditions you can ignore (you still 'have them', but they're not in your Inventory and don't affect you. They still need to be removed as per their removal condition). You have 0 Grit at 1st level, but you gain some as you <b>[Level up](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/base-rules#advancement)</b>.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Skills</b></summary>
Skills are special areas of expertise of your character. When you do something that needs special training, is particularly technical, or needs a good grasp of knowledge, you'll roll with disadvantage. If you have a skill that could work contextually, then you roll normally.

You can also get an <i>Expertise</i> with a skill, which is marked by one of your three attributes. When using your skill and you are rolling with that specific attribute, you roll with advantage.
</details>

***
## Inventory

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Inventory</b></summary>

<u><b>Inventory</b></u>. You have 10 slots, which can be filled with objects, or bundles of 3 objects like acorns or bottle caps. <b>Heavy</b> objects take two slots. You'll fill your Inventory up with objects, although it can also fill up with <b>Conditions</b>. If you have to add something to your Inventory and you don't have the space, you're <b>Exhausted</b> and you reduce your HP to 0 while you're exhausted. If you're exhausted and need to add Fatigue, you take 1 Might damage.

Generally speaking, your Inventory is less of an actual physical space on your character, and more about what your character can use in the game-world. Pretty much every character wears clothes - however, if you want to use your clothing to charm somebody, it should be in your Inventory. Small jewelry like rings can be worn on your character - but it <i>doesn't count</i> until it actually takes up space in your Inventory.

## Items and Traits

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Items</b></summary>
Items are things that you're going to gather when you're out there adventuring. They normally take up 1 slot of your Inventory. If you have it in your Inventory, you can use it.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Notches</b></summary>
All items have <b>Notches</b>, which are sort of like an item's Life. Notches represent consumption, wear and tear, and loss of power, depending on the item. A quiver full of arrows will mark Notches to show the depleting amount of arrows, a sword will mark Notches as it's getting chipped and bent, and a spellbook will mark Notches as the spell frees itself from its prison.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Traits</b></summary>
Some tools have Traits, which give a bit more info on how it can be used. It can be <i>Treasure</i> or <i>Bright</i>, for example. Here are a list of common traits and their effects.
*  <b>Treasure.</b> Many animals will accept to trade goods and services for these.
*  <b>Light.</b> This can be paired with 2 other items on the same slot.
*  <b>Heavy.</b> This item takes up 2 slots.
*  <b>Bright.</b> This illuminates your surroundings.
*  <b>Armor.</b> Damage you take by being attacked is reduced by 1. If it's Heavy, it's reduced by 2. You can only wear 1 Armor at a time.
*  <b>Shield.</b> Damage you take by being attacked is reduced by 1, although you need a hand free to use it.
*  <b>Ranged.</b> You can use this item on things that are far away.
*  <b>Food.</b> Consume this item when resting to heal your HP to max.
*  <b>Unbreakable.</b> The item has a total of 6 Notches.
*  <b>Fragile.</b> The item has only 1 Notch.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Treasure</b></summary>
When a tool has the <b>Treasure</b> trait, it also has a (Price). When you bring a treasure out from a dangerous area and into a safe area, you acquire it's Price as Adventure points (distributed evenly among all people who helped you do so). Afterwards, you can trade it to gain its Price as Coin. A treasure cannot be 'rescued' twice.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Weapons</b></summary>
Weapons are separated into different categories.
*  <b>Light melee.</b> (Daggers, knives, clubs) These take up one hand, and deal 1d6 damage. They can be <b>dual-wielded</b>. They are always considered <i>light</i> items.
*  <b>Medium melee.</b> (Swords, axes, maces) These take up one hand, and deal 1d8 damage, or 1d10 damage when wielded in two hands.
*  <b>Heavy melee.</b> (Battleaxes, halberds) These take up two hands, and deal 1d12 damage. They are always considered <i>heavy</i> items.
*  <b>Light ranged.</b> (Blowguns, slings) These take up one hand, and deal 1d6 damage. An inventory slot is also taken up by <i>Ammunition</i>. They are always considered <i>ranged</i> items.
*  <b>Heavy ranged.</b> (Longbows, crossbows, rifles) These take up two hands, and deal 1d12 damage. An inventory slot is also taken up by <i>Ammunition</i>. They are always considered <i>heavy</i> and <i>ranged</i> items.

If you are <b>dual-wielding</b>, you roll 2d6 and take the best result when you attack.

## Combat

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>
Combat starts when someone first attempts to attack. At the start of combat, roll Grace. On a success, you go before your enemies. If you're surprised, your enemies go first - if you surprise them, you go first.

When you attack someone, you don't need to roll to hit. You immediately roll the damage die of your weapon (if you have no weapon, you do 1 damage. If you're weapon is improvised, you do 1d4) and deal that much damage to your target.

</details>

***
## Exploration, Encounters and Resting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Exploration</b></summary>
When exploring or going through a locale, like a house, a dungeon, or the ruins of a village inside a forest, the locale is divided into interconnected <b>Rooms</b>. Actions that are spent inside a Room take <b>10 minutes</b>, such as investigating, fighting, or gleaning info from the blood on the walls.

When exploring the great outdoors, where the scale becomes entire forests and mountains, actions take up what's called a <b>Watch</b> (or 4 hours). The great outdoors is made up of interconnected <b>Areas</b>. There are 6 Watches in a day: Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Dusk, Midnight. Moving from one Area to a connected one takes a Watch. A good sleep takes 2 Watches.

Spending time doing strenuous physical activity causes the character to suffer <b>Fatigue</b>. Fatigue is a condition that takes up 1 slot in the character's Inventory, and is removed on a nap.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Encounters</b></summary>
When first meeting with a creature and the GM isn't sure of the kind of first impression you're making, they might ask you to roll 2d6. How the creature reacts depends on the result. The GM rolls 1d6, and the player rolls 1d6, so that the players don't know the full result.

| Reaction roll | General | Social | Monster <i>feels weaker</i> | Monster <i>feels stronger</i> |
|:--------------|:--------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| 2             | Hostile    | Rejection   | Flee        | Attack    |
| 3-5           | Aggressive | Cold        | Flee        | Attack    |
| 6-8           | Neutral    | Neutral     | Freeze      | Threaten  |
| 9-11          | Friendly   | Amicable    | Ignore      | Offer aid |
| 12            | Helpful    | High esteem | Accepts aid | Grovel    |

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Resting</b></summary>
There are three kinds of rests: <b>Sleeps</b>, <b>Naps</b> and <b>Full rests</b>.

You can only sleep if you're in a sheltered, warm and dry place, and you eat some food. Sleeping heals all HP lost, and removes Wounds if someone can tend to you. If HP is at maximum, you heal 1d6 Ability damage if someone can tend to you. Sleeping takes <b>4 hours</b>.

You can take a nap pretty much everywhere, although you still have to eat some food. Napping heals 1d6+1 HP. It takes <b>10 minutes</b>.

You can only take a full rest in complete security, on a bed in town. It heals all your HP and ability damage. It takes <b>a week</b>, although you don't need to be only in bed during this time. A week's worth of lodging and food usually costs around 20p.

</details>

## Advancement

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Path to greatness</b></summary>
Over the course of your adventure, you'll gain <b>Adventure points</b> (or <b>AP</b>). You can get AP by recovering treasure, but also by <b>spending selflessly</b> (donating to charity, helping rebuild a home for others, etc). Each 10c spent in this way grants 1 AP.

When you reach certain amounts of adventure points, you <b>Level up</b>. The following is a table with the total amount of Adventure points you need to level up again.

| Level | Hit dice | Grit | Adventure points |
|:--------------|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| 1             | 1d6     | 0      | 0       |
| 2             | 2d6     | 1      | 1000    |
| 3             | 3d6     | 2      | 3000    |
| 4             | 4d6     | 3      | 6000    |
| 5+            | 4d6     | 4      | +5000   |

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Leveling up</b></summary>
When you level up, you do the following:
*  <b>Increase your Hit Protection</b>. You gain a new Hit die, which is a d6. Roll all of your Hit die - if the sum is greater than your previous HP, this becomes your new HP. If it's less, then you increase your HP by 1.
*  <b>Increase your Attributes</b>. Roll once for each of your attributes - if you <i>Fail</i>, you increase that attribute's Score by 1.

<b>From level 5 onwards</b>, you only need 5000 additional adventure points before leveling up again. However, you don't gain any more Grit or Hit dice. You can choose to do <b>one</b> of the following:
*  <b>Increase your Hit Protection</b>. You gain +1 HP.
*  <b>Increase an Attribute</b>. Choose <b>one</b> attribute, and roll. If you <i>Fail</i>, you increase that attribute's Score by 1.

</details>

## Spellcasting

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Spellcasting</b></summary>
If you have a <b>Spellbook</b>, you can cast the associated spell. You can roll up to 4 Magic dice (that you acquire by holding <i>magical</i> items in your Inventory). The effects of the spell depend on the number of [dice] used, and the [sum] of the result.

If you roll doubles when casting a spell, you mark 1 <b>Notch</b> on it. You can only repair it by <b>Recharging</b> it.
</details>
