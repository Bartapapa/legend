Fractured form

You're filled with Writhing insects. They take up an Inventory slot. When you take damage, you can spend Magic die to have them swarm out of your body, losing them from your Inventory. This deals [dice] damage to you. The swarm has [sum] HP, deals 1d6+[dice] damage wherever they are, and makes everyone uncomfortable. When they come back to you, you recuperate [dice] HP, and they tell you what they saw and what they tasted. If the swarm is killed, it regrows inside your body over the course of a week.

Smite

You can spend magic dice to smite a target you can see with divine power. Speak a phrase condemning a target you can see. You deal [sum]+[dice] damage as a beam of fire descends from the skies - if the damage isn't enough to reduce its HP to 0, it is unscathed and immune to any further Smites from you, forever. If the damage is enough, their body is destroyed, as is their soul. If you destroy them, roll 1d6. On a 1, you add them to your Mind as a Dark Passenger. They will speak to you again.
