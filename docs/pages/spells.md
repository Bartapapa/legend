If you have a <b>Spellbook</b>, you can cast the associated spell. You can roll up to 4 Magic dice (that you acquire by holding <i>magical</i> items in your Inventory). The effects of the spell depend on the number of [dice] used, and the [sum] of the result.

If you roll doubles when casting a spell, you mark 1 <b>Notch</b> on it. You can only repair it by <b>Recharging</b> it. If it gets 3 Notches, it is destroyed and is unrepairable.

If you roll doubles when casting a spell without a spellbook (such as with the Spellmind gift), then you take 1d6 Wit damage. Make a Wit save - if unsuccessful, you get the <b>Mad</b> Condition, that can be removed after a full rest. This takes up a slot.

Unless noted otherwise, all spells with ongoing effects last [dice]*10 minutes, and have a range of up to 10 meters.
