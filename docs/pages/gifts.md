A character is defined by several <b>Gifts</b> which give unique ways of playing a character, new abilities, and alter a few others. The following is a list of Gifts that you can either choose from or roll on. Your GM might add a few, take others out, it doesn't really matter. If you don't find a trait that you'd like in here, talk about it with your GM and see if you can work something out together.

Choose or roll d666 (don't add the results, just read them from left-to-right)

<summary><b>111. Greed</b></summary>
For every Valuable or Treasure you have that takes up an Inventory slot, you gain +1 HP. You can smell gold, jewels and other precious metals - if you sniff at a crossroads, the GM will tell you in which direction are the most riches.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>112. Floating</b></summary>
You constantly hover a few inches above ground. You can hover across very still water. If you are surprised or if you fall though, you touch the ground as normal.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>113. Immortal</b></summary>
You're immortal to age, and cannot be magically aged. You can ponder a question about history, a named character or a named object over Lunch. Roll a d6 - if 6, the GM gives you a concise and honest answer (although not necessarily a complete one).
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>114. Fleet-footed</b></summary>
If you so wish, you can walk around as if you weighed only 5 kilograms. You can only do this if you don't have anything particularly heavy in your Inventory.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>115. Dwarfism</b></summary>
Only available at character generation, or if a severe magical mishap occurs.
You're half as small as the average human. You can't wield heavy weapons (melee or otherwise) or polearms, and need two hands to wield medium weapons.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>116. Battlescarred</b></summary>
All Scars in your Inventory count as Armor. You can only have a maximum of 5 Armor as per usual. When you interact with warriors and your scars are visible, you can either use +Wit for your reaction roll or +Scars.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>121. Oathbound</b></summary>
State your principal duty. When you roll for an action that pertains to your principal duty (or to avoid doing something that goes against your principal duty), you can change one of the results to a 6, and count it as if it were natural. You can only do this once per rest.
