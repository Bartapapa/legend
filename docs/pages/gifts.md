</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>12. Immortal</b></summary>
You're immortal to age, and cannot be magically aged. You can ponder a question about history, a named character or a named object over Lunch. Roll a d6 - if 6, the GM gives you a concise and honest answer (although not necessarily a complete one).
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>13. Dwarfism</b></summary>
You're half as small as the average human. You can't wield heavy weapons (melee or otherwise) or polearms, and need two hands to wield medium weapons.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>14. Fleet-footed</b></summary>
If you so wish, you can walk around as if you weighed only 5 kilograms - most pressure plates won't activate, branches won't bend, snow won't cave in, etc. You can only do this if you don't have anything particularly heavy in your Inventory.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>15. Rage</b></summary>
Whenever combat starts or you suffer from a strong emotion, you can enter a state of rage. You feel nothing else than it, and can't be charmed or mentally controlled. You add your Might bonus to all damage dealt (yes, even spells and ranged weapons). You need to attack or cast a damaging spell every turn, otherwise you attack yourself.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>16. Oathbound</b></summary>
State your principal duty. When you roll for an action that pertains to your principal duty (or to avoid doing something that goes against your principal duty), you can change one of the results to a 6, and count it as if it were natural. You can only do this once per rest.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>21. Hard to kill</b></summary>
When you fail a Might roll at 0 HP, you're never incapacitated, although you do gain an Injury. You can let yourself be incapacitated - you won't die by being left alone, and you'll wake up a few hours later.

<summary><b>23. Hatred of X</b></summary>
Replace X by some kind of creature or thing. Humans. Orcs. Kobolds. Doors. If your target resembles, even remotely, the subject of your hate, you deal +2 damage to them. This also acts as a Skill regarding the subject of your hate (however you can still be very prejudiced and biased in your knowledge, leading to potentially erroneous knowledge).
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>24. Chugger</b></summary>
When you take a short rest, you can treat any alcohol you consume as food. Additionally, you can drink a potion as movement instead of an action.
</details>

<summary><b>25. Charming</b></summary>

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>26. Liar</b></summary>
Once per rest, you can tell a lie that isn't obviously false. The people you tell it to will believe it (not necessarily act on it). They'll know after 1d6 minutes, though, and they'll come after you. 
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>31. Skeleton</b></summary>
You're a skeleton. Sharp and piercing weapons deal half damage to you, but crushing weapons deal double. You don't need to breathe, or eat, or sleep. People around you will react accordingly to your appearance - generally, the living hate the undead. The dead hate the undead.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>32. Third eye</b></summary>
You have a grotesque third eye on your forehead. As long as its open and uncovered, you can pre-emptively roll Reaction rolls with people you've never met before that you can see, before interacting with them.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>35. [Beast] speaker</b></summary>
When you get this Gift, choose a kind of beast. Dogs, cats, bats, worms, ants, etc. You can speak to these beasts freely, and understand what they say to you in return. This doesn't mean they'll like you, but most will be intrigued by someone speaking their language. Related beasts have an accent. Beasts of the same animal class (mammals, reptiles, etc) can still be spoken to, although conversations are simple.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>36. Alert</b></summary>
You can't be surprised by anything, and you have a sixth sense that tells you when danger is about to happen. Staying still for a minute, you can know the difference between a room that is silent because nothing is there, and a room that is silent because something is trying not to make a sound.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>41. Assassinate</b></summary>
For each bit of important information you have on a target, you deal +1 damage. Important information is anything that has a tangible utility to you or your party, and isn't immediately knowable by just looking at a person. This maxes out at +6 damage. When you kill an enemy, they make no sound.
</details>

If successful, the GM gives you an honest answer to one of your Big Questions.

<summary><b>45. Challenge</b></summary>
When you <i>demand</i> that someone oppose you in a challenge of wits, strength or violence, they must accept or suffer consequences. Consequences for a normal person are light humiliation - for people higher up in social standing, rank, or divine influence, the consequences can be demotion, shame, even death. You can challenge anything that understands you and is capable of being offended.
</details>

<summary><b>51. Automaton</b></summary>
You're a robot. Gain a PURPOSE attribute (capitals not optional). Your PURPOSE bonus is always equal to the highest bonus of your 3 base attributes. State your PURPOSE, which is a 3-word directive (PROTECT-THIS-DUDE, FIND-THE-ARTEFACT, KILL-ALL-HUMANS, etc). Whenever you do an action related to your PURPOSE, you can roll PURPOSE instead of any other attribute. State also what DOESN'T COMPUTE, which is a 1-word concept (Love, War, Taxes, etc). Whenever you're confronted to what DOESN'T COMPUTE, you can choose to either be reduced to 0 HP or shut down for a minute to reboot - this only happens once per scene/encounter.

Someone can reprogram you while you sleep by opening the back of your head case. Doing so, they state a new 3-word PURPOSE. You, however, choose what DOESN'T COMPUTE.

Whenever you leave town, you can spend up to 100c. Doing so, you acquire an unnamed package, that takes up a slot in your Inventory.

You can have bundles of items inside if you wish.
</details>

<summary><b>54. Field medic</b></summary>

<summary><b>56. Web of contacts</b></summary>
Once per session, you can declare that you know someone who can help you with your predicament. They might not like you. When you stay in town for a week, you automatically have a web of contacts who'll do up to mildly illegal things for you, but expect compensation in return.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>61. Nighteye</b></summary>
Your jet-black eyes allow you to see in the dark as if it were sunlight, unless there's any source of light near you. If you look intently into someone's eyes for a few seconds, you'll know their surface intentions in regards to anything they're saying.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>62. Bonded</b></summary>
Choose another person in your party. You cannot choose another person, and this bond only breaks when that party member abandons the party or dies. You immediately sense when that person is in danger, you are immune to fear when that person is incapacitated, and your heart beats stronger when that person is nearby.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>63. Throng</b></summary>
You're not an individual person, but a multitude. You can all look the same, or actually be different people. Whenever you take HP damage, some of you are knocked out in tragic-comic fashion. Whenever you recuperate HP, some of you regain consciousness, crawl out of debris, etc. Any mundane item you have in your Inventory or Mind is duplicated so each of you can use it - however its in terrible condition and not really usable by any other person. Magical items in your Inventory or Mind remain unique, and can be given normally. You can, however, only use them once per scene as one of you uses it before blending into the mass. Whenever you do laborious work, you do the work of 10 people in the same time. In-combat, you're always considered adjacent to everyone.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>64. Explorer</b></summary>
Choose three of the following adjectives: <b>barren, populated, abandoned, forested, frigid, windswept, arid, damp, craggy, dark, coastal, spooky.</b> While in an area described by that adjective, you can light a fire (given tools, fuel and 60 minutes), find enough food for one person, follow tracks a day old, and may protect one person from poor conditions.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>65. Read people</b></summary>
When you meet someone, you know 1 thing they love, and 1 thing they hate. If using the Lock & Key system, you learn 1 of each. You have a hunch when people are trying to hide their true intentions.
