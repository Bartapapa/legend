## Gifts

Gifts are special abilities granted to unique characters. They can be acquired by helping a powerful wizard, or perhaps a god, or perhaps drinking from the poisonous moon well, or even from [freeform advancing](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/additional-rules#freeform-advancement). However it is you acquire it, gifts are a good way to differentiate characters by their abilities instead of just their inventory. If you don't want to play with gifts, that's fine - just make magic items that have the effects of these gifts, and allow players to use those abilities if they have the item.

### Weaponsmaster
When making an attack with a weapon, you can attack twice. Additionally, you can use your reaction whenever you or someone at arm's length is attacked to reduce the damage dealt by 1d6.

### Spellmind
You gain +1 Magic dice. You can cast 1 spell as if you had the spellbook on you. 

### Night's eyes
Your eyes become pitch black. You can see perfectly in the dark, as long as there is no light stronger than a candle near you.
