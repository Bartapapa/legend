A character is defined by several <b>Gifts</b> which give unique ways of playing a character, new abilities, and alter a few others. The following is a list of Gifts that you can either choose from or roll on. Your GM might add a few, take others out, it doesn't really matter. If you don't find a trait that you'd like in here, talk about it with your GM and see if you can work something out together.

***

Choose or roll d666 (don't add the results, just read them from left-to-right)

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>111. Spellmind</b></summary>
Acquire a Magic die.
  
When you get this Gift, roll a random spell from the list of spells. This spell takes up a slot in your Mind.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>112. Floating</b></summary>
You constantly hover a few inches above ground. You can hover across very still water. If you are surprised or if you fall though, you touch the ground as normal.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>113. Immortal</b></summary>
You're immortal to age, and cannot be magically aged. You can ponder a question about history, a named character or a named object over Lunch. Roll a d6 - if 6, the GM gives you a concise and honest answer (although not necessarily a complete one).
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>114. Fleet-footed</b></summary>
If you so wish, you can walk around as if you weighed only 5 kilograms. You can only do this if you don't have anything particularly heavy in your Inventory.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>115. Dwarfism</b></summary>
You're half as small as the average human. You can't wield heavy weapons (melee or otherwise) or polearms, and need two hands to wield medium weapons.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>116. Battlescarred</b></summary>
All Scars in your Inventory count as Armor. You can only have a maximum of 5 Armor as per usual. When you interact with warriors and your scars are visible, you can either use +Wit for your reaction roll or +Scars.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>121. Oathbound</b></summary>
State your principal duty. When you roll for an action that pertains to your principal duty (or to avoid doing something that goes against your principal duty), you can change one of the results to a 6, and count it as if it were natural. You can only do this once per rest.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>122. Bloodthirsty</b></summary>
Whenever combat arises, keep a score of how many enemies you've killed. At the end of combat, you heal that much HP. If your HP is at its max, you instead heal Wounds.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>123. Rage</b></summary>
Whenever combat starts or you suffer from a strong emotion, you can enter a state of rage. You feel nothing else than it, and can't be charmed or mentally controlled. You don't roll attack rolls - you immediately deal damage. You need to attack or cast a spell every turn, otherwise you attack yourself. Any attack against you doesn't need an attack roll, either.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>124. Cautious</b></summary>
If you don't attack or cast a spell during your turn, your Armor is 5 (unless it was already higher). You can always ask the GM, "Is this situation about to get violent?", and they'll give you an honest answer.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>125. Hard to kill</b></summary>
You don't need to roll to Stabilize (you do however still need to spend your turn). When you have a Scar related to your attacker, you only take 1 Wound when they deeal damage to you, ignoring how much actual damage they dealt.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>126. Vandal</b></summary>
You gain +1 HP whenever you break an object. If you break a Valuable or Treasure (and you knew its value), you heal all HP. You can immediately tell if something is trying to protect or guard something else, and what that is.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>131. Hatred of X</b></summary>
Replace X by some kind of creature or thing. Humans. Orcs. Kobolds. Doors. If your target resembles, even remotely, the subject of your hate, you deal +2 damage to them. This acts as a Savvy regarding the subject of your hate (however you can still be very prejudiced and biased in your knowledge, leading to potentially erroneous knowledge).
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>132. Chugger</b></summary>
You make friends around drink. If you chug an ale in a social context, there's at least 1 person who'll be friendly towards you and come up to you. If you take an action to chug in the middle of combat (empyting an Inventory slot's worth of alcohol), you heal your HP to full.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>133. Charming</b></summary>
You make great impressions. As long as you're doing the talking, you have a +1 to Reaction rolls. Even if they don't like you, as long as you speak nicely and softly, they'll hear you out.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>134. Liar</b></summary>
Once per rest, you can tell a lie that isn't obviously false. The people you tell it to will believe it (not necessarily act on it). They'll know after 1d6 minutes, though, and they'll come after you. 
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>135. Gallows humor</b></summary>
Over lunch, you can tell a dark joke. Roll a general reaction roll. If Uncertain, your party heals 1 Wound. If Helpful or Friendly, they heal 1 Wound plus how many Mind Scars you have. In social contexts, you can draw people to you who have similar Mind Scars as you - if you joke around, you're sure to stumble upon at least 1 person with similar issues.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>136. Influent</b></summary>
Your name bears influence and power. Most people of your race will recognize you. By flaunting your influence, you can force people to act Helpful towards you, although their initial Reaction towards you degrades by one step. People above you on the social totem pole are unaffected by this.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>141. Jester</b></summary>
You can convince anyone that you're the most or least important person in a group. You can always ask the GM, 'Who's the most important person around here?', and the GM will give you a truthful answer - even if someone else is pretending to be important.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>142. Skeleton</b></summary>
You're a skeleton. Sharp and piercing weapons deal half damage to you, but crushing weapons deal double. You don't need to breathe, or eat, or sleep. People around you will react accordingly to your appearance - generally, the living hate the undead. The dead hate the undead.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>143. Oozeblooded</b></summary>
Portions cut off from your body can still be moved as if guided by you - even if your head is cut off. Over Lunch, you can reattach limbs. If you reattach them the wrong way, it'll be really uncomfortable.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>144. Arcane talent</b></summary>
You start with 1 base Magic die. If lost, you recuperate it if you have a good night's sleep. You can taste and smell magic in the air, as well as magic in objects.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>145. Third eye</b></summary>
You have a grotesque third eye on your forehead. As long as its open and uncovered, you can pre-emptively roll Reaction rolls with people you've never met before that you can see, before interacting with them. If you've interacted with someone, you can tell their current disposition towards you. These values may change depending on context.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>146. Zealous</b></summary>
Over Lunch, instead of eating, you can follow a strange esoteric ritual. Describe it. When you interact with a person of faith for a few minutes, you can immediately tell how strong is their conviction and belief in their faith.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>151. Preacher</b></summary>
When you take an hour to proselytize in a town, you attract 4d6 people. Half of them are interested by what you have to say. A quarter of them resent what you say. There's a 1-in-6 chance that one of these people is enamored by what you have to say, and will gladly join you as a Follower, with a starting Loyalty of 2.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>152. Prophecized</b></summary>
Whenever anyone rolls double '1's or '6's, you may state aloud, 'As the Prophecy foretold'. Doing so, you regain all HP, and the <i>very next</i> 2d6 roll will either be maximized (if previously double '1's) or minimized (if previously double '2's).
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>153. Of the cloth</b></summary>
Whenever you wear the vestments of your faith, you are recognized as an ordained person of that faith. Most people will be agreeable with you, and if you ask, they can shelter you and your party for the night. You immediately recognize if someone belongs to the same faith as you.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>154. Guided by Fate</b></summary>
Every time you rest, roll a d6, and note down the result. Once per rest, you can replace the result of <i>any</i> d6 you see by that result.

When you get this Gift, choose a kind of beast. Dogs, cats, bats, worms, ants, etc. You can speak to these beasts freely, and understand what they say to you in return. This doesn't mean they'll like you, but most will be intrigued by someone speaking their language.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>156. Greed</b></summary>
For every Valuable or Treasure you have that takes up an Inventory slot, you gain +1 HP. You can smell gold, jewels and other precious metals - if you sniff at a crossroads, the GM will tell you in which direction are the most riches.

By spending a week and paying one Treasure, you can create the identity of a person of interest (higher-up in an organization, baron, etc) and be well-regarded within it due to false credentials.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>166. Stalker</b></summary>

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>266. Bonded</b></summary>
Choose another person in your party. You cannot choose another person, and this bond only breaks when that party member abandons the party or dies.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>311. Defy Death</b></summary>
Once per rest, when you would die, you can laugh at the face of your Death and remain alive with 9 Wounds. If you were at 0 HP, heal 1 HP. When you do so, place a DEATH BOUNTY (capitals aren't optional) in your Mind. You'll meet your Death when you next rest, who'll demand an explanation for this.

</details>

</details>

<summary><b>313. Throng</b></summary>
You're not an individual person, but a multitude. You can all look the same, or actually be different people. Whenever you take HP damage, some of you are knocked out in tragic-comic fashion. Whenever you recuperate HP, some of you regain consciousness, crawl out of debris, etc. Any mundane item you have in your Inventory or Mind is duplicated so each of you can use it - however its in terrible condition and not really usable by any other person. Magical items in your Inventory or Mind remain unique, and can be given normally. You can, however, only use them once per scene as one of you uses it before blending into the mass. Whenever you do laborious work, you do the work of 10 people in the same time. In-combat, you're always considered adjacent to everyone.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>314. Scion</b></summary>
Acquire 1 Magic die.

Make up 3 tenets of your faith. These are the tenets you should follow. Your Magic dice become Faith dice, which act in exactly the same manner as Magic dice, but aren't recovered after a long rest like they usually would.
