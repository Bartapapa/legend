<small>Additional rules that are used in conjunction with the base rules. Certain spells and abilities refer to some of these rules.</small>

## Adventuring 

### Light
Not many characters can see in the dark. They need light to be able to act well. Characters who are unlit and need light to see have a bane on any action involving eyesight. Denizens of the underground never need light to act well.

A character who has a light tool can illuminate their surroundings, and can illmuniate up to 3 other characters.

### Poisons and disease
Poisons and disease will prevent characters from healing Fatigue when resting. Additionally, some poisons and disease will cause the character to gain Fatigue periodically.

### Falling
Characters take 1d6 damage after falling 3 meters, 3d6 if they fall 6 meters, and 6d6 if they fall 9 meters. For each additional meter fallen this way, there is a 1-in-6 risk of immediately dying. Thus, falling 15 meters is a death sentence.

If a character doesn't control their fall (they were pushed off the edge of a cliff, for example), the damage taken is as if they fell 3 additional meters than what they actually fell. If something below is there to cushion their fall (snow, hay, water, ogre belly) they count as having fallen 3 meters less than what they actually fell. Characters that fall on others both take and deal fall damage. If a character is set to catch a falling character, they aren't dealt any damage, but will take half the damage, and the falling character the other half.

Falling onto particularly soft or fitting surfaces (huge tarps stretched out by villagers) nullifies fall damage and risk of dying.

### Fire and acid
Fire and acid deals similar damage, and mechanically are similar in the ways to take it off. Flames and acid deal 1d6 damage when in contact with it. They deal 3d6 damage when half-bathed in it, and 6d6 damage when completely submerged in it. Whenever a creature is at risk of catching fire or having acid stick to it, it must roll +Grace. If failed, they catch fire or acid remains on their clothes and skin, and they take an additional 1d6 damage at the start of their turn until they spend an Action rolling, wiping themselves with something, etc.

### Huge treasures and pillaging
<small>Rules inspired by Luka Rejec's [Ultraviolet Grasslands](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/241606/The-Ultraviolet-Grasslands--Free-Introduction).</small>

Some treasures found in dungeons are particularly cumbersome. These objects count as multiple Valuables / Treasures, but take up that many slots in one's Inventory as well. If no one wants to pick it up, as many adventurers as it takes Inventory slots can pick it up together to carry it around - however, it incurs greater risk of being <b>Damaged</b> as such.

Such treasures can be too much for a party. They can, if they choose, <b>Pick it apart</b>. Doing so yields 1 object of the same value as the initial treasure, taking up 1 slot in the character's Inventory (prying the gem-eyes off of the cursed statue, for example). However, doing so <b>damages</b> the rest of the treasure, reducing its value by 1 step (from Treasure to Valuable, for example). If another adventurer were to Pick it apart, they would retrieve only a Valuable, and not a Treasure, and reduce its value furthermore.
