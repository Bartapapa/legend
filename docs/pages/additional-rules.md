<small>Additional rules that are used in conjunction with the base rules. Certain spells and abilities refer to some of these rules.</small>

***
## Social

### Contacts
Contacts are special NPCs that certain characters have access to, which can do certain favors. Contacts are generally amicable towards the character, however depending on how they're treated this can change, and a character can lose the Contact. As a quick way of determining what kinds of favors Contacts can do if not otherwise explained, the GM can roll 1d6 on the following table:

| Contact type | Favor |
|:-------------|:------|
| 1. Sage      | Can help identify certain objects, or give tidbits of information. Not necessarily correct, but always useful. |
| 2. Merchant  | Can give away freely, or at a discount, small quantities of items and tools related to their merchandise.      |
| 3. Favored   | Can grant access to otherwise reserved events and areas, and grant mild political immunity.                    |
| 4. Explorer  | Can give information regarding local areas, wildlife, and guide characters through such areas.                 |
| 5. Spy       | Can tell characters about local rumors and happenings, as well as find information regarding other NPCs.       |
| 6. Brute     | Can crack heads and intimidate people. Will do mildly illegal things.                                          |

### Keys & Locks
During interactions, NPCs have what are called <b>Keys and Locks</b>. They illustrate what the character <i>wants</i> and <i>hates</i> respectively. When interacting with this character, bringing up one of its Keys or Locks (wittingly or not) has a consequence: a Reaction roll is made, with a number of boons as the number of Keys that have been brought up, and a number of banes as the number of Locks that have been brought up.

### Followers
A follower is an NPC who helps the player character in different ways according to their abilities and the situation. A base follower has HD, HP, an Act score, a Loyalty score, and has 10 Inventory slots. Followers can do things related to their profession and character, as if they had a Savvy in that. When doing things related to their profession and character, they roll +Act, otherwise they roll +0. Whenever they are affected by fear, convinced their leader is inept, or otherwise have to prove their loyalty, they roll +Loyalty. If failed, they may run away, leave or even betray the player character.

## Adventuring

### Exhaustion
Whenever a character does something particularly straining on their body, such as staying up an entire night, trekking through heat or cold for hours on end, not eating or not drinking for a day, etc, they suffer 1 Wound. 

### Light
Not many characters can see in the dark. They need light to be able to act well. Characters who are unlit and need light to see have a bane on any action involving eyesight. Denizens of the underground never need light to act well.

Each light source has a <b>Light</b> score, which indicates how many characters are sufficiently-lit if they remain nearby.

Candles have a Light score of 1 - they only sufficiently illuminate their holder, and are prone to being quenched; there's a 3-in-6 chance that it turns off if it falls.

Torches have a Light score of 3 - and their flame is more resistant. There's only a 1-in-6 chance that it turns off if it falls.

Lanterns have a Light score of 3 - but cannot be unwillingly quenched due to their protection.

### Poisons and disease
These have an Onset, a Duration (and Frequency), Damage (and repeated damage), Side effects and potentially a Death effect. When a character contracts a disease or when a poison is first administered, they don't necessarily feel it, although the GM marks it down, along with the Onset of the poison, which determines the time that passes until they are initially affected. Once this time is elapsed, the character can roll +Might to resist the effects. They'll still take the Damage from it, although the poison or disease has been controlled by their system.

If their roll is unsuccessful, they add the poison or disease in their Inventory, which takes up a slot. Every time the time defined in Frequency has elapsed, they take another dose of Damage (written in parentheses), as well as suffering from an additional side effect (going from the first to the last, repeating he last one if necessary). This happens until the poison or disease is cured via magic or healing, or its duration wears out.

A character suffering from a poison or disease can not heal Wounds until it is cured. If a character dies while still under the effect of the poison or disease, then it suffers from its Death effect.

If additional doses of the same poison are administered before the initial Onset, this grants a bane for every dose to resist the effects. If an additional dose is administered while the creature is feeling its effects, it deals its Damage immediately.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example poison: basic poison</i></summary>
<b>O:</b> Immediate <b>D:</b> 10 minutes (1 minute) <b>Damage:</b> 1d6 (1)

<b>Side effects:</b>
1.  A burning sensation in the eyes and mouth and around the administered area.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example disease: ghoul fever</i></summary>
<b>O:</b> 1 hour <b>D:</b> 1 week (1 day) <b>Damage:</b> 1 Wound (1 Wound)

<b>Side effects:</b>
1.  Sullen, yellow eyes, coughing.
2.  Nothing.
3.  Aversion to non-meat foods. Any such food, if ingested, will be thrown up. From this point onwards, the Death effect is activated.
4.  Skin becomes pale and nearly translucent. Blood takes a purplish hue.
5.  Aversion to meat that doesn't belong to members of their own species. If no such meat exists, rotting meat works.

<b>Death effect:</b> If the character has suffered from the 3rd side effect at least, the character's Soul is destroyed, with only the Flesh soul remaining, and becomes an NPC Ghoul.

### Curses
Curses are similar to poisons and diseases, apart from them all having an immediate Onset and they are placed within a character's Mind, not Inventory. Very few of them deal direct damage. 

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example curse: blinding curse</i></summary>
D:</b> permanent (1 week)

<b>Side effects:</b>
1.  Vision becomes unfocused. Very far and very close objects are undefined.
2.  Vision becomes spotty. 1 bane on every action relying solely on sight, such as reading or investigating for physical clues.
3.  Vision becomes monochromatic. Impossible to differentiate between colors.
4.  Character is blind.
</details>

### Falling
Characters take 1d6 damage after falling 3 meters, 3d6 if they fall 6 meters, and 6d6 if they fall 9 meters. For each additional meter fallen this way, there is a 1-in-6 risk of immediately dying. Thus, falling 15 meters is a death sentence.

If a character doesn't control their fall (they were pushed off the edge of a cliff, for example), the damage taken is as if they fell 3 additional meters than what they actually fell. If something below is there to cushion their fall (snow, hay, water, ogre belly) they count as having fallen 3 meters less than what they actually fell. Characters that fall on others both take and deal fall damage. If a character is set to catch a falling character, they aren't dealt any damage, but will take half the damage, and the falling character the other half.

Falling onto particularly soft or fitting surfaces (huge tarps stretched out by villagers) nullifies fall damage and risk of dying.

### Fire and acid
Fire and acid deals similar damage, and mechanically are similar in the ways to take it off. Flames and acid deal 1d6 damage when in contact with it. They deal 3d6 damage when half-bathed in it, and 6d6 damage when completely submerged in it. Whenever a creature is at risk of catching fire or having acid stick to it, it must roll +Grace. If failed, they catch fire or acid remains on their clothes and skin, and they take an additional 1d6 damage at the start of their turn until they spend an Action rolling, wiping themselves with something, etc.

### Huge treasures and pillaging
<small>Rules inspired by Luka Rejec's [Ultraviolet Grasslands](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/241606/The-Ultraviolet-Grasslands--Free-Introduction).</small>

Some treasures found in dungeons are particularly cumbersome. These objects count as multiple Valuables / Treasures, but take up that many slots in one's Inventory as well. If no one wants to pick it up, as many adventurers as it takes Inventory slots can pick it up together to carry it around - however, it incurs greater risk of being <b>Damaged</b> as such.

Such treasures can be too much for a party. They can, if they choose, <b>Pick it apart</b>. Doing so yields 1 object of the same value as the initial treasure, taking up 1 slot in the character's Inventory (prying the gem-eyes off of the cursed statue, for example). However, doing so <b>damages</b> the rest of the treasure, reducing its value by 1 step (from Treasure to Valuable, for example). If another adventurer were to Pick it apart, they would retrieve only a Valuable, and not a Treasure, and reduce its value furthermore.
