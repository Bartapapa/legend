<small>Additional rules that are used in conjunction with the base rules. Certain spells and abilities refer to some of these rules.</small>

## Adventuring 

### Light
Not many characters can see in the dark. They need light to be able to act well. Characters who are unlit and need light to see have a bane on any action involving eyesight. Denizens of the underground never need light to act well.

A character who has a light tool can illuminate their surroundings, and can illmuniate up to 3 other characters.

### Poisons and disease
Poisons and disease will prevent characters from healing Fatigue when resting. Additionally, some poisons and disease will cause the character to gain Fatigue periodically.

### Falling
Characters lose 1 Vigor if they fall more than 3 meters, and an additional Vigor for every meter thereafter. Each heavy object held when falling makes it so you are considered to fall an additional meter.

### Fire and acid
These deal 1 damage per turn if touching it, 2 damage if wading in it and 3 damage if engulfed in it.
