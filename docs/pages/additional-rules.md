<small>Additional rules that are used in conjunction with the base rules. Certain spells and abilities refer to some of these rules.</small>

## Social

### Contacts

### Keys & Locks
During interactions, NPCs have what are called <b>Keys and Locks</b>. They illustrate what the character <i>wants</i> and <i>hates</i> respectively. When interacting with this character, bringing up one of its Keys or Locks (wittingly or not) has a consequence: a Reaction roll is made, with a number of boons as the number of Keys that have been brought up, and a number of banes as the number of Locks that have been brought up.

### Hirelings

Contacts, Key & Lock system, Merchants

## Adventuring

### Exhaustion
Whenever a character does something particularly straining on their body, such as staying up an entire night, trekking through heat or cold for hours on end, not eating or not drinking for a day, etc, they suffer 1 Wound. 

### Languages

### Light
Not many characters can see in the dark. They need light to be able to act well. Characters who are unlit and need light to see have a bane on any action involving eyesight. Denizens of the underground never need light to act well.

Each light source has a <b>Light</b> score, which indicates how many characters are sufficiently-lit if they remain nearby.

Candles have a Light score of 1 - they only sufficiently illuminate their holder, and are prone to being quenched; there's a 3-in-6 chance that it turns off if it falls.
Torches have a Light score of 3 - and their flame is more resistant. There's only a 1-in-6 chance that it turns off if it falls.
Lanterns have a Light score of 3 - but cannot be unwillingly quenched due to their protection.

### Poisons and disease
Poison deals direct wounds

### Falling

### Fire and acid

### Huge treasures and pillaging
