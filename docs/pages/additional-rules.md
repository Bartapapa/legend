<small>Additional rules that are used in conjunction with the base rules. Certain spells and abilities refer to some of these rules.</small>

## Social

### Keys & Locks
During interactions, NPCs have what are called <b>Keys and Locks</b>. They illustrate what the character <i>wants</i> and <i>hates</i> respectively. When interacting with this character, bringing up one of its Keys or Locks (wittingly or not) has a consequence: the character's Reaction goes up (if Key) or down (if Lock) by one step. Generally, people like treasures, friendship and secrets.

## Adventuring 

### Light
Not many characters can see in the dark. They need light to be able to act well. Characters who are unlit and need light to see have a bane on any action involving eyesight. Denizens of the underground never need light to act well.

A character who has a bright tool can illuminate their surroundings, and can illmuniate up to 3 other characters.

### Poisons and disease
Poisons and disease will prevent characters from healing Fatigue when resting. Additionally, some poisons and disease will cause the character to gain Fatigue periodically, or deal Ability damage. Not eating or drinking for a day is like being poisoned.

### Falling
Characters take 1d6 damage if they fall more than 3 meters, and an additional 1d6 damage for every 3 meters thereafter. Falling more than 12 meters has a cumulative 1-in-6 per meter risk of outright killing the character - so falling 18 meters is a death sentence.

Each heavy object held when falling makes it so you are considered to fall an additional meter. Falling onto softer surfaces, like sand or snow or hay, makes you be considered to fall half as much distance as what you actually fell. Some surfaces will nullify fall damage.

### Fire and acid
These deal 1d6 damage per turn if touching it, 2d6 damage if wading in it and 3d6 damage if engulfed in it. Stronger fires or acids, like hellfire or a dragon's corrosive spittle, can increase the die size to represent its increased potency.

## Exploration
<small>Rules adapted from Arnold K's [Underclock](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-underclock-fixing-random-encounter.html).</small>

### The Clock
When you enter a dungeon (any configuration of interconnected rooms) or start adventuring in the great outdoors, there's a Clock that starts at 20. Whenever a unit of time passes (a 4-hour <b>Watch</b> outdoors, or a 10-minute <b>Turn</b> inside a dungeon), a d6 is rolled and the result is subtracted from the Clock. The noise of combat doesn't provoke rolls on the Clock.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>below 0</i>, an <b>Encounter</b> happens. After the encounter is resolved, the Clock resets to 20.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>0 exactly</i>, it resets to 3 - the World's attention is elsewhere for the moment.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>3 exactly</i>, an <b>Omen</b> occurs.

> When the Clock resets to 3, it triggers an Omen.

### Encounters
Encounters are <i>dangers of the current area the players are</i>. They can be hostile monsters, patrolling guards - but whatever they are, they're not good news.

### Omens
Omens are <i>clues as to what dangers are in the current area</i>. Sounds of skittering, traces of thick cobwebs, etc. They are here to help the players understand what awaits them.

### Depth
The deeper you go, the easier it is to feel the hate of the Natural Realms. Whether this is 'deep' as in vertical depth or 'deep' as in how far it is from the civilized world doesn't matter. Areas (and the dungeons therein) have a Depth score, which ranges from d6 to d12, passing through d8 and d10. d12 is reserved for those areas that hate all that is outside it. Instead of rolling the normal d6 to count down the clock, you roll the area's Depth die.

### Connecting areas
In the great outdoors, areas are interconnected by <b>Roads</b> and <b>Paths</b>. Paths take longer to tread than roads. All paths and roads have names, and a list of dangers - generally roads are safer than paths. If you want to transform a path into a road, you'll have to complete its connection requirement, which can be as simple as fixing the broken bridge, or as complex as establishing a trade pact between two hostile factions.

Creating paths is something else. The Natural Realms hate people trying to organize it, and will stop at nothing to remind explorers of the reasons why they should've stayed home. When you want to create a path, you have to either decide if you have a destination or not. If you do, declare what's your destination. If you don't, the GM will create an area for when you 'arrive'. Whatever the decision is, determine who is your guide. The guide can change over the course of this process. The GM determines a <b>Difficulty</b>, which is a number between 5 (for straightforward hikes) and 20 (for complex, dangerous segments). The party will face obstacles that they must overcome in order to proceed. If all characters manage to overcome the obstacle, then a d8 is rolled, and the difficulty is reduced by that result. If at least one character doesn't manage to overcome the obstacle, the party must find another path around - meaning they only roll a d4. In the case of a success, if the party has a guide or has someone with a skill related to the area, then they can roll a d12. A watch passes as they overcome the obstacle (and so the Clock ticks down according to the Depth the characters are at). If the Difficulty was reduced to 0, then a path has been created in between either the chosen destination or the created landmark. Otherwise, another obstacle comes, and the characters must overcome that one. This process repeats itself until the difficulty is reduced to 0.
