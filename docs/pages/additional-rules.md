<small>Additional rules that are used in conjunction with the base rules. Certain spells and abilities refer to some of these rules.</small>

## Social

### Keys & Locks
During interactions, NPCs have what are called <b>Keys and Locks</b>. They illustrate what the character <i>wants</i> and <i>hates</i> respectively. When interacting with this character, bringing up one of its Keys or Locks (wittingly or not) has a consequence: the character's Reaction goes up (if Key) or down (if Lock) by one step. Generally, people like treasures, friendship and secrets.

## Adventuring 

### Light
Not many characters can see in the dark. They need light to be able to act well. Characters who are unlit and need light to see have a bane on any action involving eyesight. Denizens of the underground never need light to act well.

A character who has a bright tool can illuminate their surroundings, and can illmuniate up to 3 other characters.

### Poisons and disease
Poisons and disease will prevent characters from healing Fatigue when resting. Additionally, some poisons and disease will cause the character to gain Fatigue periodically, or deal Ability damage. Not eating or drinking for a day is like being poisoned.

### Falling
Characters take 1d6 damage if they fall more than 3 meters, and an additional 1d6 damage for every 3 meters thereafter. Falling more than 12 meters has a cumulative 1-in-6 per meter risk of outright killing the character - so falling 18 meters is a death sentence.

Each heavy object held when falling makes it so you are considered to fall an additional meter. Falling onto softer surfaces, like sand or snow or hay, makes you be considered to fall half as much distance as what you actually fell. Some surfaces will nullify fall damage.

### Fire and acid
These deal 1d6 damage per turn if touching it, 2d6 damage if wading in it and 3d6 damage if engulfed in it. Stronger fires or acids, like hellfire or a dragon's corrosive spittle, can increase the die size to represent its increased potency.

## Exploration
<small>Rules adapted from Arnold K's [Underclock](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-underclock-fixing-random-encounter.html).</small>

### The Clock
When you enter a dungeon (any configuration of interconnected rooms) or start adventuring in the great outdoors, there's a Clock that starts at 20. Whenever a unit of time passes (a 4-hour <b>Watch</b> outdoors, or a 10-minute <b>Turn</b> inside a dungeon), a d6 is rolled and the result is subtracted from the Clock. The noise of combat doesn't provoke rolls on the Clock.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>below 0</i>, an <b>Encounter</b> happens. After the encounter is resolved, the Clock resets to 20.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>0 exactly</i>, it resets to 3 - the World's attention is elsewhere for the moment.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>3 exactly</i>, an <b>Omen</b> occurs.

> When the Clock resets to 3, it triggers an Omen.

### Encounters
Encounters are <i>dangers of the current area the players are</i>. They can be hostile monsters, patrolling guards - but whatever they are, they're not good news.

### Omens
Omens are <i>clues as to what dangers are in the current area</i>. Sounds of skittering, traces of thick cobwebs, etc. They are here to help the players understand what awaits them.

### Depth
The deeper you go, the easier it is to feel the hate of the Natural Realms. Whether this is 'deep' as in vertical depth or 'deep' as in how far it is from the civilized world doesn't matter. Areas (and the dungeons therein) have a Depth score, which ranges from d6 to d12, passing through d8 and d10. d12 is reserved for those areas that hate all that is outside it. Instead of rolling the normal d6 to count down the clock, you roll the area's Depth die.

### Connecting areas
In the great outdoors, areas are interconnected by <b>Roads</b> and <b>Paths</b>. Paths take longer to tread than roads. All paths and roads have names, and a list of dangers - generally roads are safer than paths. If you want to transform a path into a road, you'll have to complete its connection requirement, which can be as simple as fixing the broken bridge, or as complex as establishing a trade pact between two hostile factions.

Creating paths is something else. The Natural Realms hate people trying to organize it, and will stop at nothing to remind explorers of the reasons why they should've stayed home. When you want to create a path, you have to either decide if you have a destination or not. If you do, declare what's your destination. If you don't, the GM will create an area for when you 'arrive'. Whatever the decision is, determine who is your guide. The guide can change over the course of this process. The GM determines a <b>Difficulty</b>, which is a number between 5 (for straightforward hikes) and 20 (for complex, dangerous segments). The party will face obstacles that they must overcome in order to proceed. If all characters manage to overcome the obstacle, then a d8 is rolled, and the difficulty is reduced by that result. If at least one character doesn't manage to overcome the obstacle, the party must find another path around - meaning they only roll a d4. In the case of a success, if the party has a guide or has someone with a skill related to the area, then they can roll a d12. A watch passes as they overcome the obstacle (and so the Clock ticks down according to the Depth the characters are at). If the Difficulty was reduced to 0, then a path has been created in between either the chosen destination or the created landmark. Otherwise, another obstacle comes, and the characters must overcome that one. This process repeats itself until the difficulty is reduced to 0.

## Advanced combat
<small>Rules adapted from Emanuel Galletto's [Dark Souls RPG](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2bP0GsXwg9xZnNIUjBYemVzLU0?resourcekey=0-Ssu9cfnxeIXiK6948_FRIw).</small>
For players who enjoy a bit more granularity in their combat, it is possible to use these rules for advanced combat which bring more depth.

At the start of combat, all combatants must choose whether they are <b>Reckless</b>, <b>Skirmishing</b> or <b>Retreated</b>.
* <b>Reckless</b> combatants can use melee weapons, deal more damage, and have access to specific reckless actions, but can be hit by both melee and ranged attacks and cannot use ranged weapons.
* <b>Skirmishing</b> combatants can use melee or ranged weapons, but can be hit by both melee and ranged attacks. To be targeted, the dice used needs to have a result equal or greater than 3.
* <b>Retreated</b> combatants can only use ranged weapons, but can only be hit by other ranged attacks. To be targeted, the dice used needs to have a result equal or greater than 5.

Each player combatant rolls their <b>Combat die</b>, which are d6s. They roll a number of Combat die equal to the <b>second highest</b> bonus granted by one of their attributes. Monsters usually roll a number of combat die equal to their HD. Group up the die by their results.

Each round lasts 6 turns. If players won initiative, they act first - otherwise, monsters act first.

When acting, a character can spend any dice of equal or greater value than the current turn to use a <b>Combat maneuver</b>, which are special actions. A character can only spend 1 Combat die per turn.

When the 6th turn finishes, another round starts. All active combatants roll their Combat die again, and the cycle continues until combat is finished.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>List of combat maneuvers</b></summary>

* <b>Attack:</b> a character can attack by spending one Combat die. They can use certain weapons depending on whether they're Reckless, Skirmishing or Retreated. They can target certain combatants depending on whether they're using a melee or ranged weapon. If the combatant is Reckless, they roll the damage die twice and take the better result. A character can spend a die of the same result as the one spent to make it a powerful attack, allowing the character to enhance the damage (rolling a d12).
  * <b>Block:</b> If the character has a shield and is the target of an attack, they can burn any Combat die, regardless of its value) and reduce the damage by the die's result.
  * <b>Dodge:</b> If the character is targeted by an attack, they can burn a Combat die with a result equal to the current turn number to nullify the attack. If the character has a full Inventory, they cannot Dodge. Only players, and particularly agile monsters can use this action.
* <b>Move:</b> a character can spend a Combat die to change state to either Reckless, Skirmishing or Retreated. They can also change their held weapon while doing so. The spent die's result must be at least 3 to be Skirmishing, or 5 to be Retreated.
* <b>Charge:</b> a Reckless character can charge towards a Retreated target by spending a combat die. Doing so, they change the target's state to Skirmishing, and immediately attack them as if they had done the Attack action. Only players and particularly quick monsters can use this action.
* <b>Cast a spell:</b> a character can cast a spell by spending a combat die equal to the current turn number.
* <b>Create advantage:</b> you can create an advantage by describing what you do and spend one Combat die. Doing so, choose an ally or an enemy. If an ally, they can change the result of one of their dice. If an enemy, they remove one of their lowest-result combat die. Only players, as well as particularly cunning monsters can use this action.
* <b>Use item:</b> a character can spend one Combat die to use an item that's immediately accessible or interact with the world around them.
* <b>Breathe:</b> a character can use this action, not spending any die, to increase their lowest die by 1.

## Freeform advancement

You may allow for another form of checking when a character accomplishes a drive or another task of your choosing. Essentially, you can allow your players to check anything that is written on their character sheets - inventory items, their name, etc. A character can accumulate 3 checks on the same element - when this is done, the player and the GM discuss what kind of advancement they would like, and work something out.

Checking a weapon could make it magical, for example, as the character attunes to its latent energies. Checking a tool could make it indestructible, or allow the character specifically to use it in a certain way (or cast a spell with it). Generally, advanced items become <b>Magical</b>, granting +1 Magic dice. Checking your name could grant a special, unique ability that your character discovers - check the [Gifts](https://bartapapa.github.io/legend/gifts) to get a few ideas of what these can entail.
