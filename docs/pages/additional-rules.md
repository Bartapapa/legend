<small>Additional rules that are used in conjunction with the base rules. Certain spells and abilities refer to some of these rules.</small>

## Social

### Keys & Locks
During interactions, NPCs have what are called <b>Keys and Locks</b>. They illustrate what the character <i>wants</i> and <i>hates</i> respectively. When interacting with this character, bringing up one of its Keys or Locks (wittingly or not) has a consequence: the character's Reaction goes up (if Key) or down (if Lock) by one step. Generally, people like treasures, friendship and secrets.

## Adventuring 

### Light
Not many characters can see in the dark. They need light to be able to act well. Characters who are unlit and need light to see have a bane on any action involving eyesight. Denizens of the underground never need light to act well.

A character who has a bright tool can illuminate their surroundings, and can illmuniate up to 3 other characters.

### Poisons and disease
Poisons and disease will prevent characters from healing Fatigue when resting. Additionally, some poisons and disease will cause the character to gain Fatigue periodically, or deal Ability damage. Not eating or drinking for a day is like being poisoned.

### Falling
Characters take 1d6 damage if they fall more than 3 meters, and an additional 1d6 damage for every 3 meters thereafter. Falling more than 12 meters has a cumulative 1-in-6 per meter risk of outright killing the character - so falling 18 meters is a death sentence.

Each heavy object held when falling makes it so you are considered to fall an additional meter. Falling onto softer surfaces, like sand or snow or hay, makes you be considered to fall half as much distance as what you actually fell. Some surfaces will nullify fall damage.

### Fire and acid
These deal 1d6 damage per turn if touching it, 2d6 damage if wading in it and 3d6 damage if engulfed in it.

## Exploration
<small>Rules adapted from Arnold K's [Underclock](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-underclock-fixing-random-encounter.html).</small>
All animals know what the Realms Below are - a dark, humid place that hates you the only way hundreds of tons of stone and caustic juices brewed over millennia could.

### The Clock
When you enter a dungeon (any configuration of interconnected rooms), there's a Clock that starts at 20. Whenever 10 in-game minutes pass, or the party makes too much noise, roll 1d6 and reduce the Clock by that amount. The noise of combat doesn't provoke rolls on the Clock.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>below 0</i>, an <b>Encounter</b> happens. After the encounter is resolved, the Clock resets to 20.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>0 exactly</i>, it resets to 3 - the Realms Below's attention is elsewhere for the moment.
*  When the Clock reaches <i>3 exactly</i>, an <b>Omen</b> occurs.

> When the Clock resets to 3, it triggers an Omen.

### Encounters
Encounters are <i>dangers of the current area the players are</i>. They can be hostile monsters, patrolling guards - but whatever they are, they're not good news.

### Omens
Omens are <i>clues as to what dangers are in the current area</i>. Sounds of skittering, traces of thick cobwebs, etc. They are here to help the players understand what awaits them.

### Depth
The deeper you go, the easier it is to feel the hate of the Realms Below. A dungeon has a Depth score, with 0 being on the surface, and 10 being the bowels of the world, untouched by light and by surface critters alike. The Clock is reduced by a dungeon's Depth when it is initialized and any time it resets.
