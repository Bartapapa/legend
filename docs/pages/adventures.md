A large forest spreads to the south of Port-Henry, a industrious town that bore witness to one of the most important battles to date, which happened only a decade ago. It is said that as the routed army fled the field and disappeared into the forest, their screams could still be heard over the continuing artillery fire. The Great General Desmon Caillois was never captured, and it is assumed that he perished along with the rest of his fleeing men in that same forest, disappearing along with his golden armor.
