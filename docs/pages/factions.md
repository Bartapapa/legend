## Dogs

Great explorers from the Barking Baronnies, dogs search for glory in all things. Many of them leave the baronnies in search for faraway lands and adventure to be seen as Good Dogs when they proudly return home.

## Cats

Sly and proud, most of the Lands That Be Here belong to the Tabby Duke, and adventuring cats roam in search for treasures to bring back to the Duke to be well-seen upon their return.

## Crows

Mischievous and playful, the crows hail from secretive sects hidden everywhere. Their hidden libraries, as their wisdom, is prized, and crows set to adventure aim to return with many books filled with secrets.

## Rabbits

Hailing mostly from the Lands Faraway, the rabbit nomads wander around in search for places to stay, in music and dance. Rabbit adventurers seek to make as many friends as possible when they wander, so that they may return with great stories to tell around the campfire.

## Rats

Scurrying in dark pockets of lands unmonitered by the Tabby Duke, the ingenious rats are always looking to the Longshanks to discover new technologies that they'd be able to use when they return, to prepare for the imminent war.
