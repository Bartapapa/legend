You can spend magic dice to smite a target you can see with divine power. Speak a phrase condemning a target you can see. You deal [sum]+[dice] damage as a beam of fire descends from the skies - if the damage isn't enough to reduce its HP to 0, it is unscathed and immune to any further Smites from you, forever. If the damage is enough, their body is destroyed, as is their soul. If you destroy them, roll 1d6. On a 1, you add them to your Mind as a Dark Passenger. They will speak to you again.
