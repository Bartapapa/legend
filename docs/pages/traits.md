A character is defined by several <b>Traits</b> which give unique ways of playing a character, new abilities, and alter a few others. The following is a list of Traits that you can choose from. Your GM might add a few, take others out, it doesn't really matter. If you don't find a trait that you'd like in here, talk about it with your GM and see if you can work something out together.
***

Choose or roll d66 (don't add the results, just read them from left-to-right)

## Generation traits (can only be taken on character creation)

<summary><b>11. People</b></summary>

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>12. Dwarf</b></summary>
<b>Level 1:</b> You have a beard, which takes up an Inventory slot. You can shave it off, but it'll regrow to full after a week. You can braid up to 4 Valuables into your beard (thus taking the same slot). For each Valuable you have braided into your beard, you have +1 HP.

<b>Level 2:</b> You can smell gold, jewels, treasure and precious metals. If you stand at a crossroads and sniff, the GM will tell you which direction has the most treasure. If you sniff an empty room, the GM will tell you if you smell the scent of hidden riches.

<b>Level 1:</b> You're immortal to age, and can't be magically aged. Whenever you're dirtied, humiliated, or otherwise shown in a less-than-ideal light, you take a Wound. These Wounds don't heal until you've taken care of where it comes from (cleaning up, regaining your pride, etc).

<b>Level 2:</b> Natural, non-magical terrain doesn't affect you negatively in any way. You can walk on calm water. Your hair remains splendid after swimming in saltwater. Mud doesn't stain your boots. You don't cave into snow when you tread on it. Thorns part before you. Sand holds you just enough.

All attributes +2.

Whenever you are in a situation where you're doing your purpose, roll PURPOSE instead of the normal attribute.
State also something that doesn't compute, in one word (for example, LOVE, WAR or TAXES). Whenever you're confronted with what you can't compute, either fall to 0 HP or shut down and reboot after a minute.
Someone with the appropriate tools can reprogram you while you're sleeping. They choose your new purpose. You choose what doesn't compute.
