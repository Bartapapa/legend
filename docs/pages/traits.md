A character is defined by several <b>Traits</b> which give unique ways of playing a character, new abilities, and alter a few others. The following is a list of Traits that you can choose from. Your GM might add a few, take others out, it doesn't really matter. If you don't find a trait that you'd like in here, talk about it with your GM and see if you can work something out together.

Choose or roll d66 (don't add the results, just read them from left-to-right)

## Community traits
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>11. People</b></summary>
You actually belong to a race or sub-race of people. All the Traits you have are shared among these people. Describe a few defining aesthetic features. You have 1 <b>Friend</b> from this group of people, probably from where you come from. They'll help you out anytime if you meet them. In the outside world, you represent these people. Act accordingly.

If you already have a [Community] trait, you can acquire this for free.

Instead of a race, this can be an organization, clan, family or other form of group of people.
