A character is defined by several <b>Traits</b> which give unique ways of playing a character, new abilities, and alter a few others. The following is a list of Traits that you can choose from. Your GM might add a few, take others out, it doesn't really matter. If you don't find a trait that you'd like in here, talk about it with your GM and see if you can work something out together.

<summary><b>Darkvision</b></summary>
You can see clearly in low-lit areas. When an area is only lit by candlelight, starlight or similar, you can see as if the areas were well-lit. As long as there's at least one light in your vicinity, even total darkness is a low-lit area.

<summary><b>People</b></summary>
You actually belong to a race or sub-race of people. All the Traits you have are shared among these people. Describe a few defining aesthetic features. You have 1 <b>Friend</b> from this group of people, probably from where you come from. They'll help you out anytime if you meet them.

Instead of a race, this can be an organization, clan, family or other form of group of people.
